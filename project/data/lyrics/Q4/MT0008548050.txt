Woah-woah-woo
Woah-woah-woo

I had lost that love, that love, that love before
Got mad and I close, and I close, and I close the door
And you say, "Try just once more"

And you came and you took control
You touch my very soul
You always show me that
Lovin' you is where it's at

You've made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
The others were untrue
But when it came to loving you now
I'd spend my whole life with you, girl

'Cause you came and you took control
You touch my very soul
You always show me that
Lovin' you is where it's at

You've made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
