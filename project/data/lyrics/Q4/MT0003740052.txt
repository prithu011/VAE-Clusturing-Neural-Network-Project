I've been up, I've been down
Been looking for some joy to come around
I been praying for some sunshine
Been looking for a love
That I could call mine
See I cried for so long
Now I'm ready for the tears to be gone
So , I'm calling you right now
Cause you said that I could make it
Lord anyhow

So I'm gonna wait (On you)
Cause I know that you're gonna bring
(Me through)
I know you're gonna make (Me strong)
Cause deliverance is coming and
(It won't be long)
The storm is gonna pass (Away)
I beleive it's gonna be
(A brighter day)
I can finally see ( The sun)
So I waiting on till
(Thy kingdom come)

This world could be cold
And I can feel the hurting
In my soul
But the pain it won't last long
Cause I know that you're gonna make me strong
Just take it from me
One day we're gonna be free
Weeping may endure for night
But the lord said it's gonna be alright

So I'm gonna wait (on you)
Cause I know that you're gonna bring
(me through)
I know you're gonna make (me strong)
Cause deliverance is coming and
(it won't be long)
The storms gonna pass (away)
I believe it's gonna be
( A brighter day)
I can finally see (the sun)
So I'm waiting on you till
(thy kingdom come)
