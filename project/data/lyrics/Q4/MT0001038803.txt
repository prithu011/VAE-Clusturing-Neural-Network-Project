You're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by

As long as I got you then baby, you know that you've got me, oh!
'Cause we've got our love in some R E S P E C T, oh!

Like sweet morning dew, took one look at you
And it was plain to see that you were my destiny
With my arms open wide, I threw away my pride
I sacrificed for you, dedicated my life to you

Like I would go where you lead
I'll be right there in a time of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up that hill

There's no, no looking back for us
We've got our love and sure know that's enough
You're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need, baby, baby to get by
Yea, to go by

Like an eagle protect his nest, for you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree and dare anybody that try to move me
Darlin' in you I've found, strength where I was torn down
I don't know what's in store but together we can open any door

Just to do what's good for you, I'll inspire you a little bitta higher
I know you can make a woman out of soul that didn't have a goal

'Cause we, we've got the right foundation
And with the love and determination
You're, you're all I need
You're all, you're all I need
You're all, you're all I need to get by
Yea...

Yea, as long as I got you then baby, you know that you've got me, oh!
Mm, 'cause we've got our love in some R E S P E C T, oh!
As long as I got you then baby
You know that you've got me, oh
You're all I need
You're all that I need
You're all that I need
