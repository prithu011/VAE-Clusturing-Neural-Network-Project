His eyes, her eyes
Warm and quiet lovers
Gazing, drowning
Lost in what they see
His words, her words
Strangely unrevealing
Question, answer
Careful as can be

What they say with their eyes
How they give themselves away with their eyes
They betray with their eyes
Everything they are

Is it just in a kiss
That their fences turn to dust in a kiss
Ooh they must in a kiss
Promise their tomorrows

His move, her move
Is it now or never
Heaven, Eden
Could be theirs forever

For his eyes and her eyes
Are yours and mine
