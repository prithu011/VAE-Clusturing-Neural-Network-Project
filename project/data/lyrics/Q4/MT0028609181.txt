Isn't it strange how princesses and kings
In clown-ragged capers in sawdust rings
While common people like you and me
We'll be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
A shapeless mass and the book of rules

Each must make his life as flowing in
Tumbling block on a stepping stone
While common people like you and me
We'll be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
A shapeless mass and the book of rules

Look when the rain has fallen from the sky
You know the sun will be only with us for a while
While common people like you and me
We'll be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
A shapeless mass and the book of rules
