O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exaltation
Oh sing all ye rivals
Of heaven above
Glory to God, Glory in the highest
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
