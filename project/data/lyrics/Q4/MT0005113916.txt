Oh life is so peculiar
You get so wet in the rain
You get so warm in the sunshine
It doesn't pay to complain
When I get up each morning
There's nothing to breathe but air
When I look in the mirror
There's nothing to comb but hair
When I sit down to breakfast
Nothing to eat but food
Life is so peculiar but you can't stay home and brood

Yes, life is so peculiar, a fork belongs with the knife
Corn beef is lost without cabbage
A husband should have a wife
Life is so peculiar
But is everybody's pair
That's life (that's life)
(Oh life is so peculiar, the beach has only got sand)

The oceans only got water
You never know where you stand
When I get out to dinner
There's nothing to wear but clothes
Whenever I get sleepy
There's nothing to do but doze
Whenever I get thirsty
There's nothing to do but drink
Life is no peculiar that it makes it to the top of the sink
(Life is so peculiar) it's so peculiar

A fork belongs with the knife
(The fork belongs with the knife)
Corn beef is lost without cabbage
A husband should have a wife
Life is so peculiar
That's what everybody says
(That's right) That's right
