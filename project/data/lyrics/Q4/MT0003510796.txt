I know you like that
You wanna try that
It's like a flashback
So shake your ass crack
I got the balls to
Rock the salsa
Funk the bluesa
Any groove to
Make you move 'cause
Taking you to
Another landscape
Is my mandate
I'm highly animated even though I'm decomposing
So if your feet is frozen I'm a die to see you ropin'

And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhymin' and the DJ cuttin'
I want y'all to just get down
And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhymin' and the DJ cuttin'
I want y'all to just get down

Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on shake and bake do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)

Gravitational pull
I'll have you making a fool
Out of yourself on the dance floor
Doing back spins, running man, and more
Party down with Vigga and Candor
Coming to the jam
Or look like a landlubber
And do the aqua boogie
Win lots of goodies maybe
Pop a Gucci wallet turntables is talking to me
It's awfully groovy
Seeing all the treasure and the booty

And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhymin' and the DJ cuttin'
I want y'all to just get down
And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhymin' and the DJ cuttin'
I want y'all to just get down

Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on shake and bake do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)

I wanna get down lower than Atlantis
Going toe to toe with an enchantress
Get funkier than funkadelic wearin' pampers
While you eggheads is on the wall preparin' answers
Sharing transcripts while we over here
Dipping and dancin'
Rhythm romancin'
Wallflowers
Giving no act you no
All hours we chillin' and maxin', so
Relaxing
Opposites attracting
I'm a toss my hat in
Floss when the track spin
Like I'm on a crack binge
Jigging and wiggling
Freakin' booties speakin' to the cuties so belligerent
No religion just bump the feed on
You'll feel reborn
Negativity we just dead it like dcon
Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
The pulse when it respawns

Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on shake and bake do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
