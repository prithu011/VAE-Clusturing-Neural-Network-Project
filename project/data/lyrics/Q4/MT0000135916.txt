(Silver bells, silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling),
Hear them ring (ting-a-ling)
Soon it will be Christmas day.

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks.
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
(Children laughing,
People passing,
Meeting smile after smile)
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells, (Silver bells) Silver bells, (silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling),
Hear them ring (hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas day.

(Strings of streetlights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush
Home with their treasures

Hear the snow crunch
See the kids rush
This is Santa's big day
And above all this bustle you'll hear

Silver bells) the corner Santa Claus,
(Silver bells), it's busy now because
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, (it fills the winter air)
Hear them ring (you'll hear it everywhere)
Soon it will be Christmas day.

City sidewalks, (silver bells) busy sidewalks,
(Silver bells) Dressed in holiday style
In the air (It's Christmas time in the city)
There's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, (ring-a-ling)
People passing, (Hear them ring)
Meeting smile after smile
Very soon it will be Christmas day.
