There's a place in your heart where nobody's been
Take me there
Things nobody knows, not even your friends
Take me there
Tell me about your momma, your daddy, your hometown, show me around
I wanna see it all, don't leave anything out

I want to know, everything about you
And I want to go, down every road you've been
Where your hopes and dreams and wishes live
Where you keep the rest of your life hid
I want to know the girl behind that pretty stare
Take me there

Your first real kiss, your first true love
You were scared
Show me where
You learned about life, spent your summer nights without a care
I wanna roll down Main Street, the back roads
Like you did when you were a kid
What makes you who you are
Tell me what your story is

I want to know, everything about you then
And I want to go, down every road you've been
Where your hopes and dreams and wishes live
Where you keep the rest of your life hid
I want to know the girl behind that pretty stare
Take me there

Yeah
I want to know, everything about you
Yeah, everything about you baby
I want to go, down every road you've been
Where your hopes and dreams and wishes live
Where you keep the rest of your life hid
I want to know the girl behind that pretty stare
Take me, take me, take me there
Oh

I want to roll down Main Street
I want to know your hopes and your dreams
Take me, take me there
Yeah
