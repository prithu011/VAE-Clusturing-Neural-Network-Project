I don't leave any room for doubt
When it comes to you and me
You know all about the way I feel inside
You know how hard I try
But that don't mean that I can't

Love a little stronger, dig a little deeper
Go a little farther, anything to please you girl
Tonight I'm gonna start all over
Show you girl what's in my heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh, gonna love a little stronger

You tell me you're the lucky one
But I see things differently
I have just begun to show you that you mean
Everything to me
I still feel the need to

Love a little stronger, dig a little deeper
Go a little farther, anything to please you girl
Tonight I'm gonna start all over
Show you girl what's in my heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh, gonna love a little stronger

Love a little stronger, dig a little deeper
Go a little farther, anything to please you girl
Tonight I'm gonna start all over
Show you girl what's in my heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh, gonna love a little stronger

Love a little stronger, dig a little deeper
Go a little farther, anything to please you girl
Tonight I'm gonna start all over
Show you girl what's in my heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh, gonna love a little stronger
Gonna love a little stronger
Gonna love a little stronger
