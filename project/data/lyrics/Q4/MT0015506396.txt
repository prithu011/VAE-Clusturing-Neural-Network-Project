Sometimes His eyes were gentle 
And filled with laughter, 
And sometimes they cried 
Sometimes there was a fire 
Of holy anger, 
In Jesus eyes. 
But the eyes that saw hope in the hopeless, 
That saw through the fault to the need, 
Are the same eyes that look down from heaven 
Into the deepest part of you and me. 

His eyes are always upon us 
His eyes never close in sleep. 
And no matter where you go, 
You will always be in His eyes, in His eyes. 

Sometimes His voice comes calling 
Like rolling thunder, 
Or like driving rain 
And sometimes His voice is quiet, 
And we start to wonder 
If He knows our pain. 
But He who spoke peace to the water 
Cares more for our hearts than the waves, 
And the voice that once said "you're forgiven", 
Still says "you're forgiven" today. 
Sometimes I look above me when stars are shining 
And I feel so small 
How could the God of heaven and all creation 
Know I'm here at all. 
But then in silence He whispers, 
"My child, I created you too 
And you're my most precious creation 
I even gave my Son for you." 

His eyes are always upon us 
His eyes never close in sleep. 
And no matter where you go, 
You will always be in His eyes, in His eyes. 
Sometimes His eyes were gentle, and filled with laughter.
