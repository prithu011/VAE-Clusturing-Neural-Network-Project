Um I don't wanna do wrong
But you've been gone baby so long
And I hope I hope you'll understand
That it's really, it's really oh yes it is
It's out of my hands but (I don't wanna do wrong)
I don't wanna do wrong
(But it's been so long) it's been so long
(I just can't help myself) no
(No, no, no) um

Since you been away
I been prayin' everyday
For God to make me strong till ya get back home
No, no, no, no I don't wanna do it
But my heart keeps tellin' me to
I know I tried with all of my might
Ah ha I think I've lost this fight
(I don't wanna do wrong) I don't wanna do wrong
(But it's been so long) it's been so long
(I just can't help myself)
I just can't (no, no, no)

Oh yeah, No I don't wanna
No I didn't wanna do it ooh, ooh, oh

But then again my dear
Time passed and I didn't hear
A comforting word from you to make me see
That you were still in love with me
So if by chance you've found ya' another girl
Love her and I wish ya' all the happiness in the world
'Cause I've found a new love and I can't break loose
I hope I can find happiness too
(I don't wanna do wrong)
I don't wanna do wrong
(But it's been so long) baby, baby, baby
(I just can't help myself) I just can't (no, no, no)
I just can't (I don't wanna do wrong)
Don't wanna do wrong no
(But it's been so long)
Baby, baby, baby (I just can't help myself)
I just can't (no, no, no)
