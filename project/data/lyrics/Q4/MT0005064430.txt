In the dark
 It's just you and I
 Not a sound
 There's not one sigh
 Just the beat of my poor heart
 Oh, In the dark

Now in the dark, in the dark
 I get such a thrill
 When he presses his fingertips
 Upon my lips
 And he begs me to please keep still
 In the dark

Oh, But soon
 This dance will be endin'
 And you're gonna be missed, yes sirree
 Oh gee, I'm not pretendin'
 'Cause I swear that it's so
Fun to be kissed
In the dark
Now we will find
What the rest
Have left behind
Just let them dance
We're gonna find romance
In the dark
 In the dark
 In the dark
