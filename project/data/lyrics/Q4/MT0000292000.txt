112, Harlem World, ATL
Yeah, kid, you don't stop
We won't stop, you don't stop
Come on

Baby, whenever I'm with you
No one else exists but you
'Cause you're the one for me
Every time that we're apart
You're always in my heart
And there you'll always be

Baby, don't go
Your love's so special
Can't let me go now
If I did wrong, I'm sorry
No other love is for me, oh yeah

Love me, hold me
(Why don't you)
Squeeze me
(Love me, never let me go, baby)
Hug me, kiss me
(Why don't you)
And love me
(Love me, never let go)

Whenever I'm on my way home
Just can't wait to be alone
With you, my baby
Anticipating how you'll feel
Listen to me, I'm for real
When I say I love you

Baby, don't go
Your love's so special
(Your love's so special to me, baby, oh)
Can't let me go now
If I did wrong, I'm sorry
(So sorry)
No other love (is for me, oh yes)

Love me, hold me
(Why don't you)
Squeeze me
(Love me, never let me go, baby)
Hug me, kiss me
(Why don't you)
And love me
(Love me, never let go)

Come on, yeah kid, Harlem on the rise
With 112 and you don't want no problem with these guys

Yo, you cats never want no problem like we want it (Unh-uh)
When Harlem World double up, we put G's on it (That's right)
I'm pushin' new 700 AMGs on it (Talk that ish)
And if you can't see the ice, that means my sleeve's on it (Yeah)
You know I dress as I'm suppose to
Stretch Lex with a chauffeur
Never sober, red Testarossa, cherry Rover
Baguettes in my Jehovah
Me and Puff at the Grammys, sittin' next to Oprah
(And the winner is)
All we hear is platinum that, platinum this
Platinum whips, nobody got no platinum hits (Unh-uh)
Cats know with me, platinum always wrap my wrist (Ha!)
I come to the awards, quadruple platinum chicks
Little ones like 25, what cats get smacked with
Big ones like 45, what cats get clapped with (Take that)
I react sick whenever my dough ain't accurate
Harlem World, Junior M.A.F.I.A., yeah, and that's it, come on

Love me, hold me
Squeeze me
(Love me, never let me go, baby)
Hug me, kiss me
(Why don't you)
And love me
(Love me, never let go)

Love me, hold me
Squeeze me
(Never let me go)
Hug me, kiss me
(Why don't you love me)
And love me
(Love me, never let go)

Love me, hold me
Squeeze me

Hug me, kiss me
