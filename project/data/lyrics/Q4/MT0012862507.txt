I guess I've come to live here in your eyes
This must be the place called Paradise
You are so special to me what a special time within our lives
So I guess I've come to live here in your eyes

A Thousand times I see you
A thousand times you take my breath away
Fears and doubts consume me
Afraid that someone will take it all away
I hope I'm here forever and
I think it's time that we both realize
But I guess I've come to live here in your eyes

A Thousand times I see you
A thousand times you take my breath away
Fears and doubts consume me
Afraid that someone will take it all away
I hope I'm here forever and
I think it's time that we both realize
But I guess I've come to live here in your eyes

I guess I've come to live here in your eyes
