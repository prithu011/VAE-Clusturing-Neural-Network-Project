Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, woo
Forever, forever, forever

So you're having my baby
And it means so much to me
There's nothing more precious
Than to raise a family
If there's any doubt in your mind
You can count on me
I'll never let you down
Lady, believe in me

You and I
Will never fall apart
You and I
We knew right from the start, baby, baby
The day
We fell so far in love
Now our baby is born
Healthy and strong
Now our dreams are reality

Forever my lady
It's like a dream
I'm holding you close
You're keeping me warm
If this is ecstasy
(Forever my lady)
Forever my lady
I say just what I mean
Forever and ever
I pray is what I see
(Yes, baby)

Can you picture, my lady?
This empty scene
There's no me or no you
What will we do?
An awful sight to me
If I ever lose you
Tell me where would I go
Life would have no meaning
And I pray that you
Would always stay with me, yeah

You and I
Will never fall apart, baby, yeah, yeah
You and I
Said we knew right from the start, baby, hey
The day
We fell in love, so far
Now my baby is born
Healthy and strong
And now my dreams are reality

Forever my lady
(Forever my lady)
It's like a dream
(And you know)
I'm holding you close
You're keeping me warm
If this is ecstasy
(Forever my lady)
Forever my lady
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I say just what I mean
(I say just what I mean, yes, I do)
Forever and ever
(Oh yeah)
I pray is what I see

Lady
You and I
Will never fall apart, no no
You and I
I said we made it
And I said we made it from the start
The days
We fell so far in love
Now our baby is born
So healthy and strong
Now my dreams are reality
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Forever my lady
Oh yeah, babe
(Forever my lady)
Woo, ooh
Said I pray every night, baby

Forever my lady
(Every day of the week)
It's like a dream
(Yeah yeah)
I'm holding you close
You're keeping me warm
(Keeping me warm)
If this is ecstasy
