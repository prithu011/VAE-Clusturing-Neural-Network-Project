(King of Kings, hallelujah, hallelujah)
(Lord of Lords, hallelujah, hallelujah)
In the beginning was the Word (King of Kings, hallelujah, hallelujah)
And the Word was with Jah (Lord of Lords, hallelujah, hallelujah)
And the Word was Jah
(King of Kings, hallelujah, hallelujah)
In the beginning Jah created the heaven and the earth (Lord of Lords, hallelujah, hallelujah)
(King of Kings, hallelujah, hallelujah)
Then he created man of his own likeness and image
(Lord of Lords, hallelujah, hallelujah)
Gave unto man wisdom, knowledge, overstanding (King of Kings, hallelujah, hallelujah)
(Lord of Lords, hallelujah, hallelujah)
(King of Kings, hallelujah, hallelujah)
(Lord of Lords, hallelujah, hallelujah)

Jah is my life and my strength
So whom shall I fear?
He is a shield upon my right and my left hand

So of whom shall I be afraid?
Jah is my keeper (Jah is my keeper)

Jah is my light and my salvation
So whom shall I fear?
He is my guide throughout this creation
So of whom shall I be afraid?
Jah is my keeper (Jah is my keeper)

Jah is my guide in my resting and my rising
So whom shall I fear?
He is my guide when I step out in the forwarding

So of whom shall I be afraid?
Jah is my keeper (Jah is my keeper)

Jah is my guide when the Philistines come down upon I
So whom shall I fear?
He is my guide when my enemies come to devour I

So whom shall I be afraid?
Jah is my keeper (Jah is my keeper)

Jah is my guide from the pestilence of darkness
So whom shall I fear
He's my guide from the vampires of hell

So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper (Jah is my keeper)

Jah is my keeper (Jah is my keeper)

Jah is my health and my strength
So whom shall I fear
He is a shield upon my right and my left hand

So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper (Jah is my keeper)
