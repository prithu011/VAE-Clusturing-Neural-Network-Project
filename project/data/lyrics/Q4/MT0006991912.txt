How glad the many millions
Of Timothys and Williams
Would be to capture me

But you had such persistence
You wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell

You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never, never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and nighttime hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with such emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share?
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share?
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you
