O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appears

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel!

O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan's tyranny
From depths of hell Thy people save
And give them victory o'er the grave

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel! Yeah

O come, Desire of nations, bind
And won the hearts of all mankind
Bid Thou our sad divisions cease
And be thyself a King of peace

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel!

So rejoice! Rejoice! Emanuel
Has come to thee, O Israel!
Has come to thee, O Israel!
Israel
