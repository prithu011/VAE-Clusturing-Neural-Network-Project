I search for phrases
To sing your praises
But there aren't any magic adjectives
To tell you all you are

You're just too marvelous
Too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous
And that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough
I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much
And just to very, very 
To ever be
In Webster's dictionary
And so I'm borrowing
A love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words
