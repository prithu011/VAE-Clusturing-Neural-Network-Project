Willingly I fell in love with you
Willingly I learned to love you too
Though we both knew that it was wrong to someone else we both belong
We fell in love willingly

Willingly I fell although I knew
Sweetheart I knew the same as you
So if it's fate for us to wait until our love can be
Then we'll wait willingly

I love you, I love you too
I want you, I want you too
But if it's fate for us to wait until our love can be
Then we'll wait willingly

I love you, I love you too
I want you, I want you too
But if it's fate for us to wait until our love can be
Then we'll wait willingly
