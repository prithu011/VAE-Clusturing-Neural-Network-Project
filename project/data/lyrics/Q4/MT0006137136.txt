Do they know
That Jesus was born on this day to save our lives
Do they know
That he carried the sins of the world upon his heart
So that you and I could live
And we'd have an alternative
In this life

Do they know what this day means
Do they know where we've been and how it should be
Tell me do they know
Do they know we should love one another
Do they know
The world will be alright only if they know

Do they know
That sharing love to each other is how we all should live
Do they know
That the reason for giving is more than what you give
And to you and your's this day
On a very special holiday
Give your love

Do they know what this day means
Do they know where we've been and how it should be
Tell me do they know
Do they know we should love one another
Do they know
The world will be alright only if they know

And Lord if they know
Keep them in your care
Keep them inside your heart
And help them spread the word

Do they know what this day means
Do they know where we've been and how it should be
Tell me do they know
Do they know we should love one another
Do they know
The world will be alright only if they know

Do they know what this day means
Do they know where we've been and how it should be
Tell me do they know
Do they know we should love one another
Do they know
The world will be alright only if they know
