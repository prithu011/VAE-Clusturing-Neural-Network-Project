Love is gentle as a rose
And love can conquer any war
It's time to take a stand
Brothers and sisters join hands

We got to let love rule
Let love rule

We got to let love rule
Let love rule

Love transcends all space and time
And love can make a little child smile
Can't you see this won't go wrong
But we got to be strong
We can't do it alone

We got to let love rule
Let love rule

We got to let love rule
Let love rule

You got to, got to, got to
(Let love rule)
Let love rule
You got to, got to, got to

Let love rule
(Let love rule)
Let love rule
You got to, got to, got to

Yes, yeah yeah

You got to, yeah
You got to, got to, got to, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Let love rule
