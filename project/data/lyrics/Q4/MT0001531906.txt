If I walk in the pathway of duty
If I work 'till the close of the day, Lord
I shall see the great king in all his beauty
When I gone the last mile of the way Lord, Yes Sir

Well I've gone the last mile of the way
I shall rest my at the close of day
For I know, there is a joy awaiting
Then we'll go the last mile of the way

If I were, for Christ to proclaim the glad story
If I see for his sheep who gone astray, oh lord
I am sure he will show me in his glory
When I gone the last mile of the way Lord, yes sir

Well I've gone the last mile of the way
I shall rest my at the close of day
For I know, there is a joy awaiting
When I've gone the last mile of the way
