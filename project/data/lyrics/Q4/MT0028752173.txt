es, me friend, me friend
Dem set me free again
Yes, me friend, me friend
Me deh 'pon street again

The bars could not hold me
Force could not control me now
They try to keep me down
But God put me around. Yeah!

Yes, I've been accused
Wrongly abused now
But through the powers of the Most High
They've got to turn me loose

Don't try to cold me up on this bridge, now
I've got to reach Mount Zion
The highest region
If you a bull-bucka
Let me tell you that
I'm a duppy conqueror, conqueror

Yes, me friend, me good friend
Dem set me free again, mm

Don't try to cold me up on this bridge, now

The highest region
If you a bull-bucka
Let me tell you
I'm a duppy conqueror, conqueror

Yes, me friend, me friend, me friend, me friend
We deh a street again
Yes, me friend, me friend, me friend
Dem set me free again

Fi make you friend dem laugh, what a la-la!
For i will cut you off
And i will take the last straw

I'm crying, yes me friend
We deh a street again
Yes me friend, me friend, me friend
Dem set me free again

The bars could not hold me
Force could not control me now
