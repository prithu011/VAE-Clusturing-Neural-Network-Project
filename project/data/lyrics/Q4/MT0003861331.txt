Uh, yeah, comin' right back at cha
With a different type of swing, ya know
(Somethin' for the honeys) You better ask somebody
(Somethin' for the honeys)
Baby, this is for you, and you, and definitely you

I'm the type of guy who takes time to just kick back
I turn around my baseball cap
I have a 40 sittin' on my lap
Slamming the ivories until I sees
A female worth my while
I'm scoping that ass, checking her smile
And I know that I can get it
And I'll hit it if she's wit' it
I get the five to the six, seven digits
Call her up on my cellular
And all the shit that I'll say to her
The fun will begin when I hit the skizins (Yeah)
So if a girlie is lonesome
I think that she knows where to go when she wants some
'Cause Monty ain't here for nothing, but I got a little

Somethin' for the honeys
(Yeah, from the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
Somethin' for the honeys
(You know, the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
Somethin' for the honeys, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Uh-huh, from the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
Somethin' for the honeys

Ooh, summertime, no funner time for me to kick in with you
To find something or someone to get into
I call up my crew, I tell them to bring a brew
And some Hennessy for the beach party
So call up your girlfriends
And you know there always tends to be an ugly one
But bring her, too
Fat or skinny, she likes to shoop (Shoop, shoop)
With Montell and the SL Coupe
While the beat is bumpin'
From South Central to Compton, a little somethin' somethin'
Could very well be the next Aaron Neville
Sounding like nobody 'cause I'm on another level
And you fellas can't dig it with a shovel
But it ain't for you

Somethin' for the honeys
(Yeah, from the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
Somethin' for the honeys
(Yeah) Ah, suki, suki now, honey
(Yeah, from the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
Yeah, somethin' for the honeys

This is something for the honey, yeah
(Sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
When you're rollin'
Summertime, oh so fine
It feels alright
Summertime tonight
Something for you, honey, oh

The M-O the N-T the E double L and
And yes I'm guaranteeing that I won't be failin'
Some people call me Monty, some call me Monty Swinga
Sometimes I bust a rhyme but I'm an R&B singer
And I'ma go on and flow on
And you tell two friends and she'll tell two
And so on and so on
Another number one hit so get your roll on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Somethin' for the honeys
(From the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
(You don't have to be so fly)
Somethin' for the honeys
(For me to wanna be your guy)
(From the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
Somethin' for the honeys
(From the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
(This is something for you to roll to)
Somethin' for the honeys
(And I see you, I see you)
Somethin' for the honeys
(Riding by)
(From the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
(Can I talk to you?)
Somethin' for the honeys
(Pull over, baby)
(From the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
(So I can get your number)
Somethin' for the honeys
(Pull over by the Crenshaw Wall)
(From the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
Somethin' for the honeys
(We can talk about it all, ah yeah)

Somethin' for the honeys
(A little somethin', somethin')
(From the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
(A little somethin', somethin')
Somethin' for the honeys
(We'll talk it over)
(From the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
('Cause this is just for you)
Somethin' for the honeys
(Ah yeah, I wanna talk to you)
(From the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
Somethin' for the honeys
(And if you're not down)
(From the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
(Can I talk to your friend?)
Somethin' for the honeys
(Ah yeah, and we can wine and dine)
Somethin' for the honeys
(Tell you all about it)
(From the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
(What you missed, baby)
Somethin' for the honeys
(Somethin' for you)
(From the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
(And you)
Somethin' for the honeys
(And you, and you, and, oh, and you)
Somethin' for the honeys
(And you, and for you, haha)
