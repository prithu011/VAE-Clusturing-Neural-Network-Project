Sometimes I get up feeling good but greed gets me down
I try to think about the highs, the freedom we've found
When the business in your life don't sit with your soul
And they treat you like a child they need to control

The music that we make will heal all our mistakes and lead us
The music that we hear is always standing near to feed us

We're all gonna rise above all things that we lack
Good vibrations that we make will come bouncing back

The music that we make will heal all our mistakes and lead us
The music that we hear is always standing near to feed us

The music that we make will heal all our mistakes and lead us
The music that we hear is always standing near to feed us

The music that we make will heal all our mistakes and lead us
The music that we hear is always standing near to feed us
