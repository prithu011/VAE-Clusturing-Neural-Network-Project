There's a wild streak in me, but it's only for you to see
Look to my heart, cause you know I'm ready to start
I guess I'm tryin' to say, yes, I've been waiting for this very day
Hope you're goin' too slow, cause we're about to shoot the sun a-glow

How did we make it, I do know
If there was ever a problem they had to go
Sometimes it's kinda hard, yes, I do agree
See, one plus you just equals me
They'll just watch us glow
They'll just watch us glow

Now in love something crazed, exude from your eyes when they are fixed on me
And like the eternal flame, we have a fire that won't ever stop burning
There's a power in numbers baby, but two is deemed the perfect team (Me and you equals two)
We will battle the masses baby, but we will claim the victory

How did we make it, I do know
If there was ever a problem they had to go
Sometimes it's kinda hard, yes, I do agree
See, one plus you just equals me
They'll just watch us glow
They'll just watch us glow

Some said we would never change
Look at us now, people tried to tear it all apart
Boy you stole my heart so quickly

How did we make it, I do know
If there was ever a problem, they had to go
Sometimes it's kinda hard, yes, I do agree
See, one plus you just equals me
They'll just watch us glow (Oh, they'll watch us glow)
They'll just watch us glow
How did we make it, I do know
If there was ever a problem, they had to go
Sometimes it's kinda hard, yes, I do agree
See, one plus you just equals me
They'll just watch us glow (Oh, they'll watch us glow)
They'll just watch us glow

Watch us, watch us
Oh, they'll watch us glow
They'll just watch us glow
They'll just watch us glow
They'll just watch us glow
They'll just watch us glow
