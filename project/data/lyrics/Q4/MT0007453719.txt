Treat me sweet and gentle
When you hold me tight
Just squeeze me
But please don't tease me

I get sentimental
When you hold me tight
Come on and squeeze me
But please don't tease me

Missing you since you went away
Sing the blues most every day
Counting the nights and longing for you
I'm in the mood to let you know
I never knew I loved you so
Please tell me that you love me too

For when I get that feeling
I'm in ecstasy
Come on and squeeze me
But please don't tease me

Missing you since you went away
Sing the blues most every day
Counting the nights and longing for you
I'm in the mood to let you know
I never knew I loved you so
Please tell me that you love me too

For when I get that feeling
I'm in ecstasy
Come on and squeeze me
But please don't tease me
Come on and squeeze me
Don't ever leave me
Come on and squeeze me
But please don't tease me
Come on and squeeze me
But please don't tease me
