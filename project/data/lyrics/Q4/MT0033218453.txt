This old house is falling down around my ears
I am drowning in a river of my tears
When all my will is gone you hold me sway
And I need you at the dimming of the day

You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide
You know just where I keep my better side

What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart?
Now all the bonny birds have wheeled away
And I need you at the dimming of the day

Come the night, you're only what I want
Come the night, you could be my confidant

I see you on the street and in company
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me?
I am living for the night we steal away
And I need you at the dimming of the day
Yes I need you at the dimming of the day
