Why do all my friends now want to be your lovers?
Your family got bigger when they thought you were rich
And now like maniacs, they scratch your back
Even when it doesn't itch

I want to figure it all
I want to figure it all out
I want to save you from
Save you from all the fame
Save you from the things that cause us pain

'Cause it's an animal city
It's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to bite you
It's an animal city, it's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to rip you right off

They believe you now, have everything you wanted
And once you have become a star, you've got no right to bitch
But someday when you fail, they'll put you on sale
And buy you by the inch

But you're the real deal
And "real" is your middle name
You know sometimes I feel
I gotta earn every breath you take, baby
Never mind the rules we break

'Cause it's an animal city
It's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to bite you
It's an animal city, it's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to rip you right off

With you, I feel safe
There's nothing to fear from us
Away from the fangs, the fangs of the world
I may be a coward, but you are brave
And nothing seems so dangerous

'Cause it's an animal city
It's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to bite you
It's an animal city, it's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to rip you right off
Cannibal world
Cannibal world
Cannibal world
Cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to rip you right off
