Baby, it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop
It's gotta be you
Uh-huh uh-huh, yeah!

I can't control it anymore
I've never felt like this before
You really made me lose my head
My hungry heart must be fed

Uh-huh, uh-huh
Baby, it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop

It's gotta be you (uh-huh, uh-huh)
All the way
It's gotta be you (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Everyday
I promise you I will be true, yeah
It's only you
Now I know why I was born
You feel my feelings one by one
Can't see the world I'm walking through
'Cause baby, I see only you

Oh-oh yeah
Baby, it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop
