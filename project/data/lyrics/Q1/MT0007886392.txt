C'mon now sing it now

I like to get up early in the morning
About six A.M. to be exact (yeah, that's early)
I have this chair I like to sit down in
I got the good book to sit down and read
Get my day started in the right way
I got these two little boys Taylor and Jevon
I call them in the morning
I say boys get up it's time for school
And they get on their clothes
I pour the cereal out and the sugar too, yes indeed
And I call my baby
Baby I say Debbie get up get up
It's time to get yourself together
It's such a beautiful day outside

Yes I am
I'm so happy
Simple pleasures are the best
Hell yeah

I'm so happy

Simple pleasures are the best
