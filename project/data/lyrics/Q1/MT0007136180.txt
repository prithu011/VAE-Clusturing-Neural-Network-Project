Spam in the place where I live (Ham and Pork)
Think about nutrition, wonder what's inside it
Spam in my lunchbox at work (it's the best)
Really makes a darned good sandwich anyway you slice it at all

If you're running low, go to the store. 
Carry some money to help you buy more
The tab is going to open the can
The can is there to hold in the Spam

Spam on the table at home (ham and pork)
Think about selection are there different flavors?
Spam in my office at work (it's the best)
Think about the stuff it's made from- wonder if it's mystery meat

If you need a spoon, keep one around
Carry a thermos to help wash it down
Now if there's some left, don't just throw it out
Use it for spackle or bathroom grout

Spam in my pantry at home (have some more)
Think of expiration- better read the label
Spam- breakfast, dinner, or lunch (it's the best)
Think about the way it's pre-cooked- wonder if I'll just eat it cold

Now once you start in you can't put it down
Don't leave it sitting, or it'll turn brown
The key is going to open the tin
The tin is there to keep the Spam in

Oh, Spam (Spam!)
Ham and pork
Think about nutrition- wonder what's inside it
Spam (spam!) 
It's the best
Really makes a darned good sandwich any way you slice it

Spam in the place where I live (have some more)
Think about addiction, wonder if I'm a junkie (let's eat!)
Spam in the place where I work (you're obsessed)
Think about the way is processed- wonder if it's some kind of meat

Spam in the back of my car
Spam anyplace that you are

Spam in the back of my car
Spam anyplace that you are

Oh, Spam!
