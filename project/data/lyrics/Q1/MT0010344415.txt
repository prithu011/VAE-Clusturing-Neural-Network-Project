So hot, out the box
Can you pick up the pace?
Turn it up, heat it up, I need to be entertained
Push the limit, are you with it?
Baby, don't be afraid
I'ma hurt you real good, baby
Let's go, it's my show
Baby, do what I say
Don't trip off the glitz that I'm gonna display
I told ya I'm a hold you down until you're amazed
Give it to you till you're screamin' my name

No escaping when I start
Once I'm in, I own your heart
There's no way you'll ring the alarm
So hold on until it's over

Oh, do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what I'm about to do?
'Cause it's about to get rough for you
I'm here for your entertainment

Oh, I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
But I'm about to turn up the heat
I'm here for your entertainment

It's alright, you'll be fine
Baby, I'm in control
Take the pain, take the pleasure
I'm the master of both
Close your eyes, not your mind
Let me into your soul
I'm a work it till you're totally blown

No escaping when I start
Once I'm in, I own your heart
There's no way you'll ring the alarm
So hold on until it's over

Oh, do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what I'm about to do?
'Cause it's about to get rough for you
I'm here for your entertainment

Oh, I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
But I'm about to turn up the heat
I'm here for your entertainment

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Entertainment
Oh oh... oh entertainment
I'm here for your entertainment
Ohh
Do you like what you see?
Whoa
Let me entertain you till you scream

Oh, do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what I'm about to do?
'Cause it's about to get rough for you
I'm here for your entertainment

Oh, I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
But I'm about to turn up the heat
I'm here for your entertainment
