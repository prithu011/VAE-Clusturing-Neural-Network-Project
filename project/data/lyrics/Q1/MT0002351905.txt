Six o'clock on Friday evenin'
Momma doesn't know she's leavin'
'Til she hears the screen door slammin'
Rubber squealin', gears a-jammin'
Local country station just a blarin' on the radio
Pick him up at seven and they're headin' to the rodeo
Momma's on the front porch screamin' out her warnin'
Girl you better get your red head back in bed before the mornin'

Nine o'clock the show is endin'
But the fun is just beginnin'
She knows he's anticipatin'
But she's gonna keep him waitin'
Grab a bite to eat and then they're headin' to the honky-tonk
But loud crowds and line dancin' just ain't what they really want
Drive out to the boondocks and park down by the creek
Hey, where it's George Strait 'til real late, dancin' cheek to cheek

Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Goin' 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ten 'til twelve is wine and dancin'
Midnight starts the hard romancin'
One o'clock that truck is rockin'
Two is comin', still no stoppin'
Break to check the clock at three
They're right on where they want to be
And four o'clock get up and goin'
Five o'clock that rooster's crowin'

Yeah, they ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Goin' 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up

Six o'clock on Saturday
Her folks don't know his on his way
The stalls are clean, the horses fed
They say she's grounded 'til she's dead
Well, here he comes around the bend
Slowin' down, she's jumpin' in
Hey, mom, you're daughter's gone
And there they go again, hey

Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Goin' 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
