What a night, what a moon, what a boy!
What a moon, what a night, what a boy!
Those white clouds hang in the air like toy balloons
Say, they just hang in the air that's made for honeymoons

What a hug, what a kiss, what a boy!
What a game!, oh, what bliss, what a boy!
Is it a wonder my heart is full of joy?
What a night, what a moon, what a boy!
