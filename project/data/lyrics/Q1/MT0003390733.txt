Whoo!

Let you take me out
I know what you are all about
But when I did
I wasn't trying to lead you on

Now you bring me home and tell me
Good night's not enough for you
I'm sorry, baby
I didn't mean to turn you on

You read me wrong
I wasn't trying to lead you on
Not like you did
I didn't mean to turn you on

You read me wrong (You read me wrong)
I wasn't trying to lead you on
I want a friend
I didn't mean to turn you on
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on

I know you
Expecting a one-night stand
When I refused
I knew you wouldn't understand

I told you twice
I was only trying to be nice
Only trying to be nice
Oh
I didn't mean to turn you on

You read me wrong
I wasn't trying to lead you on
Not like you did
I didn't mean to turn you on

You read (You read) me wrong
I wasn't trying to lead you on
(Lead you on)
I want a friend (A friend)
I didn't mean to turn you on (Oh)
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on
Oh
(Turn you on)

Why should I
Feel guilty cause I won't give
Feel guilty cause I won't give in
I didn't mean to turn you on
I did, did, did, did, did, did, baby

I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
(I didn't mean to)
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on

I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on

I didn't, didn't
I didn't, didn't
I didn't, didn't
I did, did, did, did, did, did, baby
I didn't mean to turn you on
(I didn't mean to turn you on)
I didn't mean to turn you on
(I-I-I-I)

I didn't mean to turn you on
(I didn't mean to turn you on)
I didn't mean to turn you on
(You know I didn't, baby)

I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on

You think that I'm a fool
Cause I wouldn't play
By your rules
(I didn't mean to turn you on)

You don't stand a chance
All I want to do is dance with you
(I didn't mean to turn you on)
I told you twice
I was only trying to be nice
(I didn't mean to turn you on)

I loved you for a friend
But I guess this is
The end of our relationship
Cause I didn't mean to turn you on

I didn't mean to turn you on
(You know I didn't)
I didn't mean to turn you on
(I didn't mean to)
I didn't mean to turn you on
(I never meant to)
I didn't mean to turn you on
(I didn't mean to turn you on)

I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on

I-I-I didn't mean to turn you on
I-I-I didn't mean to turn you on
I-I-I didn't mean to turn you on
I-I-I didn't mean to turn you on
