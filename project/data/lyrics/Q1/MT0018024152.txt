(Yeah, yeah)

So what you see is only half the story
There's another side of me (Yeah)
I'm the girl you know, but I'm someone else too
If you only knew

It's a crazy life (Crazy life)
But I'm alright

I got everything I've always wanted
Livin' the dream
So yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl whose dreams came true
But underneath it all, I'm just like you

(Yeah, yeah)

Don't wanna be treated differently
I wanna keep it all inside
Half the time, I've got my name in lights
The other half, I'm by your side
It's a crazy life (Crazy life)
But I'm just fine

I got everything I've always wanted
Livin' the dream
So yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl whose dreams came true
But underneath it all, I'm just like you

Yeah, yeah
Can't you see I'm just an ordinary girl? (Ah)
Livin' in an extraordinary world
Tryin' to live (Tryin' to live)
Tryin' to learn (Tryin' to learn)
Tryin' to just be who I am
Who I am

I got everything I've always wanted
Livin' the dream (The dream)
So yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl whose dreams came true
But underneath it all, I'm just like you

I got everything I've always wanted
Livin' the dream (Livin' the dream)
So yeah, everything I've always wanted (I've always wanted)
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl (Lucky girl)
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all, I'm just like you
