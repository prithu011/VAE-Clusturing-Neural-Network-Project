I wanna grow up to be a politician
And take over this beautiful land
I wanna grow up to be a politician
And be the old U.S. of A.'s number-one man

I'll always be tough but I'll never be scary
I wanna shoot guns or butter my bread
I'll work in the towns or conservate the prairies
And you can believe the future's ahead

I'll give the young the right to vote as soon as they mature
But spare the rod and spoil the child to help them feel secure

And if I win election day I might give you a job
I'll sign a bill to help the poor to show I'm not a snob

I'll open my door I'm charging no admission
And you can be sure I'll give you my hand
I wanna grow up to be a politician
And take over this beautiful land

I'll make you glad you got me in with everything I do
And I'll defend until the end the old red white and blue

I wanna grow up to be a politician
And take over this beautiful land
And take over this beautiful land
And take over this beautiful land
