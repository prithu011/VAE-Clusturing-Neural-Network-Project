Stand! In the end you'll still be you
One that's done all the things you set out to do
Stand! There's a cross for you to bear
Things to go through if you're going anywhere
(Everybody say)
Stand! For the things you know are right
It's the truth that the truth makes them uptight
Stand! All the things you want are real
It's just you to complete and there is no deal

Yeah yeah yeah
Oom bah bah bah
Oom bah bah bah
Stand! Stand!

Huh! Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Stand! Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya

Stand! They will try to make you crawl
And they know what they're saying makes no sense at all
Stand! Don't you know that you are free?
Well, at least in your mind if you want to be

(Everybody say)
Huh! Hah! Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya, yeah yeah ya ya
Huh! Hah! Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Huh! Hah! Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Huh! Hah! Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
