Pull out the vert, let's be out
And I don't know about you
But I'ma get it poppin' like I'm supposed to do
Don't hold your breath, girls, breathe out
Sweat out your perm, pull your weave out
And tell the world it's time
That we gonna be heard, we gonna scream out loud, say

I'ma make it happen, I'ma make a way
If you got somethin' to prove and you feel the same way
Say I, I
I'ma keep it gangster, I'ma make it hot
If you feelin' like I do, then people, throw your hands up
And say I, I (I)

You wanna dance, then get down
You're tryna chill, then sit down
Do what you wanna do
Don't let nobody tell you what you're supposed to do
You on the corner, you grindin'
Tryna duck the feds, you ain't tryna do no time, and
I know you feel it's rough (Ayy)
And if you with me, people, let me see your hands up and say

I'ma make it happen, I'ma make a way (Yeah)
If you got somethin' to prove and you feel the same way
Say I, I (Y'all heard the lady, haha, say I if you feel it, yeah)
I'ma keep it gangster, I'ma make it hot (You already know what it is)
If you feelin' like I do, then people, throw your hands up (TC, show me)
And say I, I (I) (I got it from here Chris, damn)

"Best father in the world," that's what my son would say
"Won't stop 'til you broke," that's what his moms would say

Say I, I
