Listen, baby
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby

If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far (don't worry, baby)
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry

Oh, baby, there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, baby

Remember the day
I set you free
I told you could always count on me, darling
From that day on
I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Some way, somehow

'Cause, baby, there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, baby

Oh, no, darling
No wind, no rain

No winter storm can stop me, baby
No, no, baby
'Cause you are my goal
If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just sing for me
Oh, baby, ha

My love is alive (ooh)
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart

If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can
Don't you know that there

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

Don't you know that there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
