(It's gonna be me)
Oooh yeah

You might've been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in
No man, no cry
Maybe that's why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what?
It's gonna be me

You've got no choice, babe
But to move on and you know
There ain't no time to waste
You're just too blind to see
But in the end
You know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally (finally)
Get to love somebody (somebody)
Guess what
It's gonna be me (me)

(It's gonna be me)
Ay, ay, ay
Oooh yeah, yeah

There comes a day
When I'll be the one, you'll see

(Lance: It's gonna...)
(Joey: Gonna...)
(Justin: Gonna...)
(JC: Gonna...)
(Chris: Gonna)
Justin: It's gonna be me

All that I do is not enough for you
Don't wanna lose it but I'm not like that
When finally (finally)
You get to love (ah, ah ah)
Guess what?

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
(For you, babe)
You don't wanna lose it again
(Don't wanna lose it)
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally (finally)
Get to love somebody (love)
Guess what
It's gonna be me
Every little thing I do (ah, ah ah oh!)
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
(Don't wanna lose it)
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally (finally)
Get to love somebody (love somebody)
Guess what?
It's gonna be me
