Mustang Sally
Guess you better slow that Mustang down
Mustang Sally, now baby
Guess you better slow that Mustang down
You've been running all over town
Ooh, I guess you gotta put your flat feet on the ground

Sing it, too long time, girls

All you wanna do is ride around Sally (ride, Sally, ride)
All you wanna do is ride around Sally (ride, Sally, ride)
All you wanna do is ride around Sally (ride, Sally, ride)
All you wanna do is ride around Sally (ride, Sally, ride), tell you
One of these early mornings
I'm gonna be wiping those weeping eyes, yeah, alright
I bought you a brand new Mustang (ride)
It was a nineteen sixty five
Now you come around, big fine woman
Girl, you won't, you won't let me ride
Mustang Sally, now baby (Sally, now baby)
Guess you better slow that Mustang down (down), alright
You've been running all over town
Oh, I guess you gotta put your flat feet on the ground
Oh yeah, baby, you gotta put your flat feet

All you wanna do is ride around Sally (ride, Sally, ride)
All you wanna do is ride around Sally (ride, Sally, ride)
All you wanna do is ride around Sally (ride, Sally, ride), ah yeah
All you wanna do is ride around Sally (ride, Sally, ride)
One of these early mornings
I'm gonna be wiping those weeping eyes, yeah
Oh yeah, baby, come on, boys

Those weeping eyes, oh yeah, babe (Sally)
Those weeping eyes (Sally), yeah hey, yeah
Those weeping eyes (Sally), yeah yeah (Sally)
Oh, those weeping eyes (Sally)
Those weeping eyes (Sally), those weeping eyes (Sally)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey yeah
