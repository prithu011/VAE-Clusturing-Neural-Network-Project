You've got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mr. In-Between

You've got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
Have faith, or pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene

To illustrate
His last remark
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark
What did they do
Just when everything looked so down?

Man, they said we better
Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mr. In-Between
No, do not mess with Mr. In-Between!
Do you hear me, hmm?

Oh, listen to me chillin' and-uh you will hear
About eliminatin' of the negative and a' accent on a' positive!

And gather round me children if you will and...
And sit tight while I start reviewin' the attitude of doin' right

You gotta ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mr. In-Between

You got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
Then
Otherwise, otherwise
Pandemonium liable to walk upon the scene
To illustrate (well illustrate!)
My last remark (You got the floor)
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark
What did they say (What did they say)
Say, when everything looked so down?

Man, they said we better
Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mr. In-Between
No, don't mess with Mr. In-Between!
