Mighty love, Mighty love
It's once in a lifetime, and this time, it's mine

Never ever, ever gonna let you go
'Cause I'm always gonna love you
There's so much you haven't seen that I can show you
But I never wanna shove you
Maybe ladies come and maybe ladies go
(But I'll tell you) this lady's stayin'
And if you don't want to rush it we can take it slow

Baby it's a special thing, and there's no reason to explain
This is what so many long for, this is

A mighty love, a mighty love
No push or shove, we're all dreamin' of
A mighty love, a mighty love
It's what we want, and there can never be no other love
I swear I'll never have you ride in back, in tow
(I swear) I'll never hurt you
Darlin' I could never be with anyone else
'Cause you're all I need to know
And I won't ever let you go

Baby it's a special thing, and there's no reason to explain
This is what so many long for, this is

A mighty love, a mighty love
No push or shove, we're all dreamin' of
A mighty love, a mighty love
It's what we want, and there can never be no other love

No one will ever know
Maybe ladies come and maybe ladies go
(But I'll tell you) this lady's stayin'
And if you don't want to rush it we can take it slow

Baby it's a special thing, and there's no reason to explain
This is what so many long for, it's

A mighty love, a mighty love
No push or shove, we're all dreamin' of
A mighty love, a mighty love
It's what we want, and there can never be no other love
