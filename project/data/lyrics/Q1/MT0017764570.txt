I'm just built like this (Engulfing), engulfing
Love making is a zone, the rhythm, the music
The movement, wet, devotion
Are you focused? Are you? (Yeah)
I can help you last forever
(If you know, respect it) Connect
(She says things to me like) "Keep me coming"

As the seconds turn to minutes
As the minutes turn to hours (Take your time)
As the sound of love is hollered
Time just keeps elapsing
And I just keep climaxing
With sweaty palms to say the least
(Sweaty palms to say the least)
You know just what to do to curl my toes
When she blows, there I go
I lose all control and there's no need for batteries
Once you turned on your light

Marathon (Marathon), marathon (Marathon), marathon
Your love-making's like a marathon
Marathon, marathon, marathon, marathon, on and on and on
Your love-making's like a...

Roll me something, baby
Let me light you
I respond to her femininity and say...

The sweet taste of heaven
I taste when I kiss you
Sugar, you fulfill the passion
You make all my daydreams come true, yeah
I'm caught in your seduction
You make me lust for more and more
(When it rains) When it rains, girl, it pours
From the vibe to the core
Now feel your hands stretch my back
As you play in my lap
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Like a marathon, baby
Let it go (Let it go), let it go (Let it go)

Marathon (Marathon), marathon (Marathon), marathon
Your love-making's like a marathon
Marathon, marathon, marathon, marathon, on and on and on
Your love-making's like a...

Marathon, a marathon
Your love-making's like a marathon
Marathon, a marathon
And I wanna thank you, baby
(Your love-making's like a marathon)
Ooh, I just wanna thank you
Marathon, a marathon
Your love-making's like a marathon
(Like a marathon) Marathon
Said I'm tryna keep up and keep my cool
(You go on and on)

Marathon (Marathon), marathon (A marathon), marathon
Your love-making's like a marathon
Marathon (Marathon), marathon, (A marathon), on and on and on
Your love-making's like a... marathon

Marathon, ooh yeah, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, yeah, ooh
Your love-making's like a...
Ooh, my way, you can go, oh
Your love-making's like a...
