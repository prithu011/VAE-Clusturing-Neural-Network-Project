Like a little old fashioned music box
With just one tune to play
My heart keeps singin' "I love you"
Twenty-four hours a day

Like a little old fashioned music box
That skips a note or two
My heart keeps missin' a heart beat
Singin' its song about you

And although the song we know is old
It's still the sweetest story ever told

Like a little old fashioned music box
With just one tune to play
My heart keeps singin' "I love you"
Twenty-four hours a day
