Sunflower, good morning
You sure do make it like a sunny day
Sunflower, fair warning
I'm gonna love you if you come my way

Now, if there's a chance that romance can find you
Better not find you looking the other way
Now, isn't it time you finally take it
Make it so real it steals your breath away
Hey hey hey

Sunflower, good morning
You sure do make it like a sunny time
Sun morning, good morning
And someday, child, I'm gonna make you mine

Well, if there's a chance that romance will find you
Better not find you looking the other way
Isn't it time you finally take it
Make it so good it steals your breath away
Hey hey hey

Sunflower, good morning
You sure do make it like a sunny time
Sunflower, sweet morning
For every time I'm gonna make you mine
