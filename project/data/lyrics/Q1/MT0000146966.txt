Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker, and then

I got a girl lives up on the hill
I got a girl lives up on the hill
Says she gonna love me but I don't believe she will

You gotta shake your moneymaker
Shake your money maker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker, and then
I got a girl and she just won't be true
I got a girl and she just won't be true
She's locked to the bridge, she won't do a thing I tell her to

She won't shake her moneymaker
Won't shake her moneymaker
She wanna roll her activator
She won't shake her moneymaker
She won't shake her moneymaker
She won't
