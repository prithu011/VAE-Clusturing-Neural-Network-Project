It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone
It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone
Because my mind I'm still gone
In a day that has passed and gone

Every time I see a woman
And folks she make me think of mine, think of mine
Every time I see a woman, see a woman
And folks she make me think of mine
And that's why, that's why
And folks I just can't keep from cryin'

It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone
It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone
Now I'm living in the memory
Of a woman that has passed and gone

My doctor put me on
Milk, cream and alcohol
My doctor put me on, put me on
Milk, cream and alcohol
Said, "Johnny your nerves is so bad, so bad, Johnny
Until you just can't sleep at night"
Oh yea, oh yea

It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone
Mmm
