I know it's wrong, things I do
The way that I, mistreated you
But I know oh-ho, it's a sin
It's a sin

She's stood and watched me
From the side
Oh, she hung her head and cried
But I know whoa-oh, it's a sin
It's a sin

My baby told me
Yes, from the start
She said, "Darlin' you breakin' my heart"
But I know oh oh, it's a sin
It's a sin
