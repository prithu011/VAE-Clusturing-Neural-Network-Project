It's all over, didn't even cry
I just stop living when you said goodbye
It's all over, can't feel a thing
I just stop living couldn't stand the pain

There are no light leaves in September
Lips as fresh as spring
Love that warms like summer sun
Shouldn't die when winter comes

It's all over, didn't even cry
I just stop living when you said goodbye
It's all over (it's all over)
