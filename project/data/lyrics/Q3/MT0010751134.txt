Thru the sleepless nights I cry for you
And wonder who is kissing you
Oh these sleepless nights will break my heart again

Somehow thru the day I don't give in
I hide the tears that wait until
Oh these sleepless nights will break my heart again

Why did you go why did you go
Don't you know don't you know I need you
