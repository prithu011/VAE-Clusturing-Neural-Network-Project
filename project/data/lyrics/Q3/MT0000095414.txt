The hours of the day
The hours of the day
I wait for the night
I wait for the night

The hours of the day
The hours of the day
I wait for the night
I wait for the night

I see the waves passing by the sea
I see the waves passing by the sea

The hours of the day
The hours of the day
I wait for the night
I wait for the night

The hours of the day
The hours of the day
I wait for the night
I wait for the night

I see the stars shouting your name through the air
I see the stars shouting your name through the air

The hours of the day
The hours of the day
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

I go by the fields asking where are you?
I go by the fields asking where are you?

Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you?
