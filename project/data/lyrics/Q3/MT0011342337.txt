All I can do is sit alone
In my room, baby, thinking about you
How could this be that you are not here with me?
When I gave you the best of me
I face each day, each day
Without a smile and life seems so unfair
I feel like I wanna die 'cause you didn't even give me a last
You didn't give me a last goodbye, baby

I've waited weeks for your call
I've waited here by the phone
But when the silence grew long
It grew too long
I knew that something was wrong
Right then I knew it, babe
How could you do it, babe?
How could you do it?
How could you tear my poor heart in two?
Why did you have to go away?
How could you do it, babe?
How could you do it to me?
How could you do it, do it, do it, do it?
How could you do it, baby, and tear my poor heart in two?

Ain't no more blue up in my sky, only cloudy mornings, ha
And these tears like rain you left behind
All of those memories in the corner of my mind
I started looking at us at a picture
In a frame as I start to cry
'Cause I can't picture us apart
Oh my God, can you help me? Can you help with this pain?
With this pain I'm feeling deep down inside, lord?

I've waited weeks for your call, yes, I did
I've waited here by the phone, every day
But when the silence grew long, it grew long
I knew that something was wrong
Right then I knew it, babe, baby
How could you do it, babe?
How could you tear my poor heart in two?
How could you do it?
How could you do it to me, baby?

Girl, tell me it's not true
Will I have to spend the rest of my life without you?
How can I get through?
How can I get through this pain of losing you?
Baby, tell me why

I've waited weeks for your call
I've waited for your call
I've waited here by the phone, by my phone
But when the silence grew long
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it
Something was wrong, baby
I knew that something was wrong
Right then I knew it, babe
How could you do it, babe?
Why'd you do this to me
Why'd go away?
How could you tear my poor heart in two?
I've waited weeks for your call
I've waited here by the phone
Break it down, break it down, break it down, break it down, break it down, baby
But when the silence grew long
I knew that something was wrong
Right then I knew it, babe
I didn't mean to do it
I didn't mean to do it
Whatever I did
How could you do it, babe?
How could you tear my poor heart in two?
Whatever, whatever, oh no, no, no
How could you do it, babe?
And you know
You know do it, do it, do it?
How could you do it baby and tear my poor heart in two
Sorry baby, baby
Said I'm so sorry, baby
