Don't be light
Don't be light
Don't be light

Don't be light

Don't...don't...don't....

Don't
Don't be light
Don't
Maybe like me
Don't be light
Don't be light
Don't be light
Maybe like me
Don't be light

Don't be light
Don't be light
Aah, wild life
The grey surprises of our days
Singing in caves
Fabricating a new abandon
We don't see the master's hand
We bang on gold tambourines
In the cross hairs of some transient gun
Trading desires on the banquet line

La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Don't
Don't be light
Don't
Maybe like me
Don't be light
Don't be light
Don't be light
Maybe like me
Don't be light
