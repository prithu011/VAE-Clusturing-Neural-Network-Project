(Travis Tritt/Gary Rossington)

I took some time down by the ocean
Just to try and shake the notion
That my world could not continue without you
So I took a long vacation
Traveled all around the nation
Trying hard to rearrange my point of view
I went from Birmingham all the way to Boulder
And when I looked over my shoulder
All I could see was your sweet face shining though
And no matter how hard I try
To fight off the urge to cry
It seems there ain't no vacation from the blues
And I can run but I can't hide
From the pain I feel inside

And there's no one but myself left to accuse
So with all these bridges burned
There's no pages left to turn
And there ain't no vacation from the blues
Baby, don't misunderstand me
I'm not playing any games
I'm trying to find a rainbow
But I can't find it for the rain
So with all these bridges burned
There's no pages left to turn
And there ain't no vacation
Said there ain't no vacation
Said there ain't no vacation
From the blues
