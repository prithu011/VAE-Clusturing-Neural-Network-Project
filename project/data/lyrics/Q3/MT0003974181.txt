Who wants love?
Love is a joy we borrow
Paid back in tears tomorrow
So who wants love?

Who wants love?
Something to fill your heart with
So very soon to part with
So who wants love?

Love is a dream of weaving
Moonbeams in patterns rare
Love is a child believing
Stories of castles in the air

So who wants love?
I'll go away without it
I know too much about it
Who wants love?

Love is a dream of weaving
Moonbeams in patterns rare
Love is a child believing
Stories of castles in the air

So who wants love?
I'll go away without it
I know too much about it
Who wants love?
Who wants love?
