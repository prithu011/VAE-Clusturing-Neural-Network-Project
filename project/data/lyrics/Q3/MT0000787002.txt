I had a job, I had a girl,
Had somethin' goin' mister in this world.
I got laid off down at the lumber yard,
Our love went bad, times were hard.
Now I work down at the carwash where all it ever does is rain,
Don't ya feel like I'm a rider on a downbound train?

She just said "Joe, I gotta go
We had it once, we ain't got it anymore."
She packed her bags, left me behind,
She bought a ticket on the Central line.
Now I sleep- I hear that whistle whinin'
I feel her kiss in the misty rain,
Lord I feel like a rider on a downbound train.

Last night I heard your voice-
You were cryin', cryin' you were so alone.
You said your love had never died-
You were waitin' for me at home.
I put on my jacket, I ran through the woods, 
Ran 'til I thought my chest would explode
There in the clearing, beyond the highway, 
In the moonlight ,our weddin' house showin'
I ran through the yard, I burst throught the front door, 
My head poundin' hard, up the stairs I climbed,
The room was dark, our bed was empty-
And I heard that lone whistle whine...
And I dropped to my knees, hung my head and cried.

Now I swing a sledge hammer on a chain gang
Layin' down cross ties in the misty rain
And I feel like I'm a rider on a downbound train . . . .
