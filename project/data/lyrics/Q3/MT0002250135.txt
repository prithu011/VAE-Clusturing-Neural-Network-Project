The currents want to pull you down
The bottom is empty, invisible
Where is the shore
Oh I can't see it anymore
Feeling so tired, have to keep floating
The bottom is so far away
The shore is so far away
The finish line is out of sight
I won't give up without a fight
It's such a long swim
The waves are coming at full force
And even though I thrash about
It only makes it worse
I only get more tired

Have I gotten out so far
I don't know where the boat docks are
And the moon just laughs at me
A sickle in a cotton veil
Will I make it through this gale
It's such a long swim
It's such a long swim, it's such a long swim
It's such a long swim, it's such a long swim

I was standing on a pier
Was it very far from here
Nothing but the water sounds
And if I had it in a glass
I could drink it down and laugh
I would laugh and drink it down
The water is so pure tonight
It brings you life yet makes you drown
The fish must be laughing

I have seen the boats of steel
I have used a fishing reel
I am bobbing like a cork
In this never-ending dark

I am soaked from toe to chin
I will not let the water in
Is there any use at all
To fight against this heavy tide
Will it take me in its stride
It's such a long swim
It's such a long swim, it's such a long swim

I was sitting in the sand
Waves were tumbling with the wind
They pulled him out
They pulled him in
The stretcher brought him back again
The sirens let the swimmers know
Not to wrestle undertoes
It's such a long swim

And now there is no sign of land
The breakers are behind me now
Splashing in a hopeless flow
Far above the muddy sand

Will I dry off on the rocks
Will I ever see the docks
The beacons must have all burnt out
I am flooded with this doubt
It's such a long swim

It's such a long swim, it's such a long swim
It's such a long swim, it's such a long swim
It's such a long swim, it's such a long swim
It's such a long swim, it's such a long swim
