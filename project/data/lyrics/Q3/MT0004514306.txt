You live your life like it's on rails
No choice where you go, you're on rails

We stumble through
And I think I am linked up to you
'Cos I can never think of you without this sorow

What can you do
In the face of all your dreams
When your destination's never where it seemed, where it seemed
We like to think that we choose our fortune
Like spinning a whell
But with leaves on the track you tell me
How does it feel?
