Red Lipstick letter
'Cross the mirror this morning.
Said, Good-bye, baby.
You left without warning.
Like a thief in the night,
You ran away with my heart.
I can't believe my eyes,
Must be a bad dream.
You always said
We had a good thing.
You never once let on
That we were falling apart.

That ain't no way to go.
Girl, it just ain't right.
Don't you think
That I deserve
To hear you say goodbye?
That ain't no way to go.
Was it all a lie?
After all this time,
That ain't no way to go.

Getting nowhere,
I'm tired of thinking.
Guess I'll do a little
Wishful drinking.
Make a whiskey wish
Upon a star.
Train whistle blowing
Down the tracks.
Lonesome sound says
She ain't coming back.
It's such a cold blow
From out of the dark.

That ain't no way to go.
Girl, it just ain't right.
Don't you think
That I deserve
To hear you say goodbye?
That ain't no way to go.
Was it all a lie?
After all this time,
That ain't no way to go.
