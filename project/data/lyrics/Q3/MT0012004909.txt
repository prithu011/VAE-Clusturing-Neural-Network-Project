I'm standin' at the crossroads in life
And i don't know where to go
You know you've got my heart,babe
But my music's got my soul
Let me play it one more time
Tell the truth and make it right 
And hope they understand me

Now i lay me down to sleep
And pray the Lord my soul to keep
If i die before i wake,feed Jake
He's been a good dog
My best friend right through it all
If i die before i wake,feed Jake

Now Broadway's like a sewer
Bums and hookers everywhere
Winos passed out on the sidewalk
Doesn't anybody care?
Some say "He's worthless,just let him be!"
I for one would have to disagree
And so would their Mama's

Now i lay me down to sleep
And pray the Lord my soul to keep
If i die before i wake,feed Jake
He's been a good dog
My best friend right through it all
If i die before i wake,feed Jake

Now if you get an ear pierced
Some will call you gay
But if you drive a pick-up
They'll say "No,you must be straight!"
What we are and what we ain't
What we can and what we cain't
Does it really matter?

Now i lay me down to sleep
And pray the Lord my soul to keep
If i die before i wake,feed Jake
He's been a good dog
My best friend right through it all
If i die before i wake,feed Jake

If i die before i wake,feed Jake
If i die before i wake... 
Feed Jake
