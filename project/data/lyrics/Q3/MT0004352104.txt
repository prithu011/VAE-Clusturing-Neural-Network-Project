When you give more than you get
You're in danger (You're in danger)
You may find that you're in love with a stranger
(With a stranger)
For who knows what evil lurks within the hearts of men?

It's vanity
Insanity to play when you can't win
When you find that you're losing
It's time to get on moving
Cause there's danger: heartbreak dead ahead
It only takes one second, girl, to learn
(To learn)
That playing with fire will get you burned
(Get you burned)
Now girl, don't you be foolish

They say that love is blind
But it's clear as the highway sign
That reads "Danger: heartbreak dead ahead"
Heartbreak dead ahead

Read the sign, girl
You'd better mind, girl
Yeah, danger: heartbreak dead ahead

Once the lying starts
Start packing up your heart
Listen to me, girl

When there's nothing to be gained
Don't keep going on in vain
Cause there's danger: heartbreak dead ahead
I said there's danger
I said there's danger
