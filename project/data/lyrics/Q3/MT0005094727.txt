You gonna miss me, baby
Oh Lord, when I'm gone
You gonna miss me, baby
Oh Lord, when I'm gon
I tried my best to please you
But we just can't get along

I'm gonna make a change for the better
And I want you to understand
I'm gonna make a change for the better
And I want you to understand
I tried to be a good child all my life
But I know I'm not to blame

I said now bye, bye, bye, baby
I've said my last goodbye
I said now bye, bye, baby
You know I said my last goodbye
You know that you treated me wrong
That I know you thought you'd have cried
