Love me forever or not at all
End of our tether, backs to the wall
Give me your hand, don't you ever ask why
Promise me nothing, live till we die

Everything changes, it all stays the same
Everyone guilty, no one to blame
Every way out brings you back to the start
Everyone dies to break somebody's heart

We are the system, we are the law
We are corruption, worm in the core
One of another, laugh till you cry
Faith unto death or a knife in your eye

Everything changes, it all stays the same
Everyone guilty, no one to blame
Every way out takes you back to the start
Everyone dies to break somebody's heart
Oh, my lost love, come on back to me

Love me or leave me, tell me no lies
Ask me no questions, send me no spies
You know love's a thief, steal your heart in the night
Slip through your fingers, best hold on tight

Everything changes, it all stays the same
Everyone guilty, no one to blame
Every way out brings you back to the start
Everyone dies to break somebody's heart
Oh, my lost love, come on back to me
