(Oh, least of all,)
(Least of all you)

Who in all this world did I
Think would be untrue
Woh woh, least of all
Least of all, you.

Who did I expect the last
And tell me we were through
Wooh, least of all
Least of all, you.

You, who were so understanding me
Who said to me
We would always be together
Through eternity.

Who now would I like to see
Her the way I do
Wooh, least of all
Least of all, you.

You who were so understanding me
Who said to me
We would always be together
Through eternity.

Who now would I like to see
Her the way I do
Woh Woh, least of all
Least of all, you.

Ohh, least of all
Least of all, you...
