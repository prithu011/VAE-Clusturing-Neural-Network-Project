Destroyed
In leaving I took the truth
I've learned
Never could I trust in you
Wasted
Those years are lost in my head
No more
In ashes now you lay

Before I end my time
I shall rise
Before I end my time
Rise above it all again
See you
You're crawling down on your knees
No tears
You'll never see tears from me
Long road
Still losing the apathy
I've learned
Learned how to walk away

Before I end my time
I shall rise
Before I end my time
Before I end my time
Before I end my time
I shall rise

Rise above it all again

Before I end my time
