You know it never meant much to me
There's something on your mind that I couldn't see
It didn't hurt me too much to find
You were seeing someone else for all of this time
You know that I don't care
And I'd like you to know that I don't care

I don't need your sympathy
Why don't you ever look at me

You did nothing for me
You did nothing I see
You did nothing for me
You did nothing

There's no today and there's no tomorrow
Where you find sadness I find sorrow
Nobody knows but it always shows
I think I'm losing my mind but that's the way that it goes
And it's fine, all those lies
I can see the truth lies in your eyes
So I guess we are through
You did to me what I did to you

You did nothing for me
You did nothing I see
You did nothing for me
You did nothing

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

I don't need your sympathy
Cause you don't mean that much to me

You did nothing for me
You did nothing I see
You did nothing for me
You did nothing I see
You did nothing for me (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
You did nothing I see (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
You did nothing for me (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
You did nothing (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

You did nothing for me (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
You did nothing I see (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
You did nothing for me (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
You did nothing
