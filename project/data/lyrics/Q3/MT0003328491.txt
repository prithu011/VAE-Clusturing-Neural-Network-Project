I been feeling very weak I been turning pretty pale
First I'm falling to my knees then I'm hanging by my tail
Asked the doctor for some medicine he said there's nothing we can do
The preacher said it's gonna kill you son mama dropped the chicken soup

I'm gonna need a little help help help while I'm getting over you
I'm just a flicker of myself self self your hurt has cooled my fire into
If you could spare a little touch touch touch I might survive a week or two
I'm gonna need a little help help help while I'm getting over you

Ever since you made me leave can't remember wrong or right
When I'm up I wanna sleep when I'm asleep I wanna fight
Dialed the number for emergency sheriff said to tough it out
I called my psychic friend on channel three and she confirmed without a doubt

Bells are ringing in my ears wolf is howling in the yard
But the only thing I hear is the pounding of my heart
I saw my picture in the evening news I had a caption by my head
They polled the people for the public view and nearly everybody said

I'm gonna need a little help help help while I'm getting over you
I'm just a flicker of myself self self your hurt has cooled my fire into
If you could spare a little touch touch touch I might survive a week or two
I'm gonna need a little help help help while I'm getting over you

I'm gonna need a little help help help while I'm getting over you
I'm just a flicker of myself self self your hurt has cooled my fire into
If you could spare a little touch touch touch I might survive a week or two
I'm gonna need a little help help help while I'm getting over you
