Where is the sun? Oh, clouds above me
Where are the birds that used to sing?
Everything's wrong, oh, where is their song of love?

Where is the one who said he loved me?
Gone like the flowers he used to bring
Can it be true there's somebody new to love?

Listen, my heart
Don't feel so bad
Think of the kisses we knew
You know, my heart
The moments we had
Maybe he misses them too

Where is the sun? Oh, clouds above me
Don't take the dreams to which I cling
Where is the sun? Oh, where is the one I love?

Listen ,my heart
Don't feel so bad
Think of the kisses we knew
You know, my heart
The moments we had
Maybe he misses them too
Where is the sun? Oh, clouds above me
Don't take the dreams to which I cling
Where is the sun? Oh, where is the one I love?
