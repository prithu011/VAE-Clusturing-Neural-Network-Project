The moon looks down and laughs
And says, "I told you so"
Why did I let you go away
I was so sure you loved me madly

And when I wanted you
You'd gladly come back to me
I never realized the day we said goodbye
How very sorry I would be

And every night when I walk
Up and down this lonesome town
The moon looks down and laughs at me
