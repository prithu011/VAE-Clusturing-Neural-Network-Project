I'm gonna tell you
What you need to hear
And I'm a little too late
By three or four years

And it may not make much sense
Now that we are apart
But I'm going to stop pretending
That I didn't break your heart

You see I never thought enough of myself
To realize
That losing me could mean something
Like the tears in your eyes

And I want to tell you I'm sorry
And it's too late to start
But I'm going to stop pretending
That I didn't break your heart
And it's Christmas Eve
Years down the line
Sitting here wishing I'd treated you better
When you were mine

And I have no way of knowing
Where you are
But I'm going to stop pretending
That I didn't break your heart

I didn't mean to hurt you
I didn't know what I was doing
But I know what I have done
