Curl myself into this hell forever
Fail to cut the demons off of my back
Drown into a world of lie and filth
Separating me from myself

The bastard inside me
Will one day wake up and die

Lying cheating drowning....
...In my own shit

Separation of my soul 
Separation of my soul 

Drown in my own shit
Fail to cut the dragon
Separate... the dragon by the balls
Curl myself into this hell forever
The bastard inside me
Drown into a world of lie and filth

Separation of my soul 
Separation of my soul
