C'mon man

And with the local DBC news. LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
Word
But tonight

Don't call it a comeback
I been here for years
Rocking my peers and putting suckers in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom

Explosion, overpowering
Over the competition I'm towering
Wrecking shop
When I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops

Don't you dare stare
You better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price

I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)

Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm

Just like Muhammad Ali they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
'Cause you know I had beef with

Why do you riff with me? The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready 'cause it might go
Blaw
How ya like me now?
The Ripper will not allow

You to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blasting
Outlasting
Kinda like Shaft
So you could say I'm shafting

Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)

Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Yeah)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Yeah)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Uh)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Huh)

Breakdown!

Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio (huh!)
I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new tour

I'm going insane
Starting the hurricane
Releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain
I maintain
Unless ya say my name

Ripping, killing
Digging and drilling a hole
Pass the Ol' Gold

I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)

Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill at will
The man of the hour
Tower of power
I'll devour

I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand
That I'm not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
Damn!

Ooh!
Listen to the way I slay your crew
Damage (uh), damage (uh), damage (uh), damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy soft suckers I'll slay him

Farmers (What!) Farmers (What!)
I'm ready (we're ready!)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town
(Get down!)

Don't you never, ever
Pull my lever
'Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load

I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock hard!
Knock you out
Mama said knock you out

I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (huh!)
Mama said knock you out (huh!)

Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Damn)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie

They all fell

I excel They all fell
I excel They all fell
I excel They all fell
