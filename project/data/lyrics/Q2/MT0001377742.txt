Castile and Aragon
Was his domain
Grand inquisition over all of Spain
He settled the appeals
Made to the Holy See
The fear of death forced foes to pee

Witchfinding tribunals
High council hearing
Let Heretics and Jews the inquisition bearing
Hammer of Heretics
Light of Spain
Death by fire the Inquisitors campaign

Come on witch
Burn for sin and dance the Lambada
Now listen bitch
Fear my name - Tomas Torquemada
De Torquemada
Burn
Burn bitch burn
Burn in hell
Impenitent sinner
Flogged to death
Burned at the stake to the last breath
Auto da Fe
Wanna save your life then hide or run

Senor Inquisidor
No mercy for them
Torture, confess and then condemn
Edict of expulsion
Converso and Jew
Sangre Limpia - total death to Hebrew

Burn
Burn Jew burn
No return
On the stake and burn
Remember my name
Tomas Torquemada
Grand Inquisitor
