A monument in time
A proof of having been alive
Evidence of existence
Beyond the naked eye
There's chaos in control
Visions clash and breed apart

A new level of commitment
In time this world will see
That this is real

No one, nothing will ever change
This word will always remain the same

A new level of commitment
In time this world will see
That this is real
A monument in time
A proof of having been alive
Evidence of existence
Beyond the naked eye
There's chaos in control
Visions clash and breed apart

Forgetting the past is ignoring the future
Forgetting the past is ignoring the future

No one, nothing will ever change
This world will always remain the same
