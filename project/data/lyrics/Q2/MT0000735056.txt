Strengthened individuals
Encouraged for unity
We've been pushed to the limit
Through an established motivation
Gathered in love to Christ our head

Come on let's join in synergy
Conspiracy constructed with hope in sight
A rebellious enthusiasm - united by Christ
To vulcanise the spirit filled thrash forever

Revitalization is what we want to see
Of the moving solidarity
By given strength community will be found
Let's exploit our nerve of optimism
By flash we'll go separate ways
By spirit we'll unite
It's time to make a change of mind
To conquer egocentricity

Together we will conjure up
A zealous wish to sacrifice the singularity
For the growth of this body
For the kingdom's progress
