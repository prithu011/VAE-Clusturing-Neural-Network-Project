Five more to fix, then I'll get my kicks
They will lead me astray
Crush my guilt before six
So you won't you take it away

Blackout cause you'll never know
Blackout as you reach the zone
If there's a chance you can get them all
Before you choke
Don't turn around if you've got it all
Don't turn around as you hear the call
If there's a chance, you will let it grow
Before anyone knows

Five more to fix, then I'll get my kicks
They will lead me astray
Crush my guilt before six
All that is left behind
Turn on the light and you'll realize
What is lost and'll be found
Make it right and degenerate
So you will take it away

Blackout cause you'll never know
Blackout as you reach the zone
If there's a chance you can get them all
Before you choke
Don't turn around if you've got it all
Don't turn around as you hear the call
If there's a chance, you will let it grow
Before anyone knows
Cause it's aching, it's breaking
There's something you should know
Cause it's waiting, it's plaguing
There's one more left to go

Blackout cause you'll never know
Blackout as you reach the zone
If there's a chance you can get them all
Before you choke
Don't turn around if you've got it all
Don't turn around as you hear the call
If there's a chance, you will let it grow

Before anyone knows
Before anyone knows
Before anyone knows
Before anyone knows
