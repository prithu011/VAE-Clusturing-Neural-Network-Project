Early in the morning
We heard the engines roar
In the sky

Thunder breaks the silence
When fire fills the sky
Burning sky

The rivers begin to boil
There's no escape, we're bound to die
Red-coloured is our soil
The death's falling from the sky

Detonations around us
We all prepare to die
Die!

Dead men don't tell tales
In silence we will lie
Forever lie

The rivers begin to boil
There's no escape, we're bound to die
Red-coloured is our soil
The death's falling from the sky
