Let the torture begin!

Can't you see what this does to me?
Extreme writhing, feeds my ecstacy!

I will take you down, to the depths of my mind
You will surely drown in my sickness unconfined
I will take you down to the depths of our minds
You will surely drown in our sickness intertwined!

You profuse misery, feeds our salacity
Unending, mental bludgeoning

Sickness intertwined
Look to me and find
An accomplice in slaughtering
Sickness intertwined!
I will take you down, to the depths of my mind
You will surely drown in my sickness unconfined
I will take you down to the depths of our minds
You will surely drown in our sickness intertwined!

Conquering!
Your mind and soul..
Forsaking, your sanity
Come with me, lets begin the butchery
Obscene revelry
Intertwined
