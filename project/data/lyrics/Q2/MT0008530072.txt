Take my eyes, compare your own damnation, you are the same, a fallen soul. 
Breaking the soul my words are worthless fading through time my confidence deceased. 
Through my eyes winter fog, this is why, this is I. 
Fall damned and disgraced can you see now 
I will not believe darkness has taken my soul (reside in my thoughts). 

Haunted by visions, attacked by the serpents of doom, holding onto me, 
Craving the taste of my blood (seven years as beast I have been cursed). 
Fake a smile, wear a mask, hidden truths, hidden lives, this war will last forever. 
Fallen soul trapped in hell, darkness frees, light reveals. 
Push me back into the shadows. 

As I walk through the land of fallen souls ghosts rip me, savoring my flesh. 
Take me this time silent lullaby, show me wrath, show me pain, I will show you mine. 
Back through time my heart is broken, in my past my future burns. 
A black rose withered and torn stands alone never known, always knowing.
