Scarred, emotion infiltrates my soul. 
Suffer, the hierarchy takes control. 
Insane, no matter where you run you die. 
Breaking the chain. 

In your eyes I see a void. 
Pain, the depths of terror spent. 
Haste, your friend when no-one cares, 
A wraith of evanescent hope. 

In your eyes I see a void. 
Pain, the depths of terror spent. 
Take this chance to fight or die. 
I can taste your fucking lies. 
Scream, Bleed, Dream, Fail. 
Free from torture, recite the pain, did you like it? 
Are you proud? 
It wasn't what you thought it was gonna be.
