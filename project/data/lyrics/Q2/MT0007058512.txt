Do you remind another time
Another place, the meeting
Volunteers you?
Do you remind me and us
Do you remind us and me
Remind shouts, remind fire
Remind suffering, remind light
Captured, tortured
Humiliated, sentenced
Sentenced to die by fire
Then return
In another time...
All forget, all start again
Remind
