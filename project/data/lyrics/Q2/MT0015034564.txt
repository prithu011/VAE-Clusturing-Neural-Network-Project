Living and learning
Crashing and burning
Giving and taking
Broken and breaking
You chose your fate
Far too little, far too late

There's never been a reason
To question anything there's nothing left here
When there's nothing in return there's never been a reason
I've seen through everything
There's nothing left here
When there's nothing in return

Kicking and screaming
Dying and dreaming
Giving and taking
Broken and breaking
You chose your fate
Far too little, far too late
There's never been a reason
To question anything there's nothing left here
When there's nothing in return there's never been a reason
I've seen through everything
There's nothing left here
When there's nothing in return

When the lines divide
And the dream collides
With a truth you've forgotten
You'll say it's all fallen apart

There's never been a reason
To question anything there's nothing left here
When there's nothing in return there's never been a reason
I've seen through everything
There's nothing left here
When there's nothing in return

Falling apart
Falling apart
Falling
