Oil remove
Shred tear
Radiation vapor air
It's the fear
So unclear
Man in motion
Going nowhere
In our homes
Stuck in the face
Spread the dirt to populace
Yellow journal yellow journal
Set the pace feel the rage
Manifestations of a sort
So insidious off the point
Simple solution
Never confusion
Sport a gun kill a cop
Crazy world of weary thought
So receive me had enough
Lock me up
Lock me up

Rot and assimilate
Hot to annihilate
(tear your face)
Rot and assimilate
So hot to annihilate
(hit with mace)

"is it safe?"

Deviation tonic mess
Prolonged existence innocence
See he who speaks
Isn't weak
Wheelchair future so to speak
Bubonic plague
The truth of AIDS
Community avoid decay
In the trench of pestilence
The bible screams
Announce your faith
Mutterings of death to bring
Suffocate a new born thing
Degradation of an age
Venereal
Its all sensation
Protect design
The moral plan
Infallible
As propaganda
Completely black
With no steps back

Hot to Assimilate
(go nowhere)
Rot or Annihilate
(tell yourself)
Hot to assimilate
(search your soul)
We'll rot or annihilate

Agony
Inner thinking brain
Clanking change
Growing pain

"is it safe?"

Bloodshot

Mutterings of death to bring
Suffocate a new born thing
Degradation of an age
Venereal
It's all sensation
Protect design
The moral plan
Infallible
No propaganda
Completely black
With no steps back
Agony profusely stains
The inner thinking of the brain
Clanking change
Experiments with groans of pain
It's all preferred that no one blames
The terror in an animal screams
In cages our future
The answer's insane

Rot and assimilate
(show no faith)
So hot to annihilate
(each adds assimilate)
Rot and assimilate
(each one assimilates)
So hot to annihilate

Reach for an air way
Death death death...
