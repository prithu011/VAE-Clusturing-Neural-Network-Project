Gather your emotions in fragile mortality
Try to grasp my infinite darkness
Feel the crawling prescense, breed on evil thoughts
In the void around your tortured being
Contemplate the untold curse of my region
Created to suffer the naked cold death
Peeling you layer by layer, skin fleash and bone
Embrace the horror inflicted by me

Cascades of atrocity, emerge from the inner circle

I am the master of my realm
I will decide the pain
Show me your mind
Believe, confess, comply

Evolving to a certain state of perfection
Your soul is my pleasures tool
Unpurified intoxicated structures of creation
Flooding your existence with total despair
By suffering I will restrain the source within
Shaping myself with dissolving remains
Transmutation totally absorbing your life
For the flesh, by the flesh I will fill your void
Between shadows and darkness, denying the light

I am the master of my realm...
