If one day you'd backed up a promise you made
We'd have to make it a holiday
'Cause we both know that day would never come again
If one day your word was as good as gold
It'd be too late cos I'd be too old
I don't think a human being could live that long

I never gave a damn
I was never even a fan
The only thing that makes me smile if your pain
I don't even care
When did you treat anyone fair?
To say I'm not enjoying this would be insane

Sodium Pentathol was an idea I had
But what does the truth mean now
To all the lost souls you've grabbed

A mass delusion, there's no confusion
Just a hypocrite
Who'd never cop to it

You're in total control and you're still a liar
I can't drink from the cup
I question your authority
You gotta 'fess up
You're in total control and your faith is tired
I can't drink from the cup
Where is truth in the trinity
You gotta 'fess up

If the affects you it's hard to tell
You spent too many cold days in your cell
Never been one to admit that something, might be wrong

I never gave a damn
I was never even a fan
The only thing that makes me smile is your pain
If I ever had the chance
I'd kick out your chair just to watch you dance
Irrelevant, your vanity prevents change

Sodium Pentathol still sounds great to me
An imitation of life buried in theology

Cop to it
You're in total control and you're still a liar
You're in total control and your faith is still
I can't drink from the cup
'Fess up
