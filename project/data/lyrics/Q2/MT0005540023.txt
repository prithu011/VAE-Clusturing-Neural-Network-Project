The beast is coming
The beast is coming to your world
The beast is coming
The beast is coming to your world
Never, ever, ever ever, ever
Seen a beast here looking through

It says in the Bible
The dark cometh and the beast will reign
It says in the Bible
The dark cometh and the beast will reign
And you'll be like the beast, too
Sharp, sharp pointed fangs

Beast beast beast beast beast beast
Beast beast beast beast beast beast
Beast beast beast beast beast beast
Beast beast beast beast beast beast
Beast beast beast beast beast beast
Beast beast beast beast beast beast
Beast beast beast beast beast beast
Beast beast beast beast beast beast beast
The beast is coming
Make sure don't make darkness
With fire flames all around
The beast is coming to your house
The beast is coming to your town

It says in the Bible
The dark cometh and the beast will reign
It says in the Bible
The dark cometh and the beast will reign
One thing about the beast, now
He stays in his own name
