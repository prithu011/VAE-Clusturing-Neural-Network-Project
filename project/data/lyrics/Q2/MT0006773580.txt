Oh come all ye unfaithful
Decaying and wretched
To this cradle of impiety
To lay your impure heads

Fare thee well
Or fare thee ill
One way or another
Some blood shall spill

What to do?
Inter? Cremate all those who've died from all the hate
From this execrable aggregate
That nurtures the corrupt?

Proselytes
Anchorites
Crusaders, wet me with your cathar kiss
Bow to them?
Crawl for them
Those loathsome mahometic effigies?
No!

Once, there were boundaries
The lay of the land was well defined
Came a hell of rats, and now
"Le temps entre chien et loup" is nigh
"Manquerais-je de Fidélité dans mon Pays? Jamais!
Cessons nos reculs pour nous trouver des bastions
Dans des terres lointaines:
Les fauves nous harcélent á tout jamais
C'est donc á nos de passer á l'action"

In houses of fire, where everyone dies
On the killing grounds of war, in the torn flesh and flies

I know I saw you there

In the heart of disease, where love is a stone
On the faces of those whose hate is as bone

I know I saw you there
Where hatred rules supreme
