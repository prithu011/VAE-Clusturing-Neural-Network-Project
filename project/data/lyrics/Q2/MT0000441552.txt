Like an anchor tied around my ankle
But i want to swim
But but but i've got to breathe

They're big fucking stars i swear to god they are

For all the money that you spend
We will earn it
Hold ourselves responsible
We're good for it
Kinda had that feeling that you won't
At least now you can't say i didn't ask

Push it back push it back bring us back upfront
Gaining momentum now
Uh huh you're falling in luck
Would you like it wait your turn
Oh wait or would you like it again

They're big fucking stars i swear to god they are

For all the money that you spend
We will earn it
Hold ourselves responsible
We're good for it
Kinda had that feeling that you won't
At least now you can't say i didn't ask
Can't say i didn't ask yourself
To do anything
Was the trust ourselves
Guess it's clear that its not whats going on

You're like an anchor tied around my ankle
You're like a ship that passes right on by
You're like a kid on a shore thats just like wrapped in a wave
And we're just waiting to die

They're big fucking stars i swear to god they are

For all the money that you spend
We will earn it
Hold ourselves responsible
We're good for it
Kinda had that feeling that you won't
At least now you can't say i didn't ask
