Once form of rule, in command with absolute power
Follow and you live, betray and you will cease to remain
Looked upon as a God, obeying his word, this self made martyr
Take heed to the laws, devotion and fear
Empowers control...
Control...
Control!!!

Excess of adherents, who admire and fear
Loyalty enforced with domination
Abide by the orders of this tyrranic oppression

Millions dedicate their lives to survive
Adhere to the sovereign rule

Power to gain, hung are the slain
Those who oppose the tyrants reign
Once form of rule, in command with absolute power
Follow and you live, betray and you will cease to remain
Looked upon as a God, obeying his word, this self made martyr
Take heed to the laws, devotion and fear
Empowers control...
Control...
Control!!!
