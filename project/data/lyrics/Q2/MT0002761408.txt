A wasteland so vast and I am on my own
I'm dying to fast, I'm dying to slow
Nothing here is real, the shadows walk alone
Pain is all I feel, from the thorns of my crown

And I need you right now
And I need you by my side
And I need you right now
And I need you here to night

A beauty from the past, withered in the heat
It was spoiled all to fast and shattered at my feel
Now I am a stranger in the land where I was born
Lacking the savior, the one I had before

I'm a blind man that can see
I'm a deaf man that can hear
I'm a number inside a number
I'm a dead man that can breath

And I need you right now
And I need you by my side
And I need you right now
And I need you here to night
