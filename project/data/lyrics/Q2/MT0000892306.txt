I won't let you keep killing off my prophets
I'll do all I can to stop you, to bring an end
The deceit will face defeat
Together we can end their reign
The deceit will face defeat
Together we can end their reign

Born in blood!
Forces that be!
Brought to their knees! (there's nowhere to run)
The time is now! (they know they're the ones)
To redound

History is (repeating)
They must explain (the bleeding)
On our ignorance (they're feeding)
We can't let history repeat
We must not be afraid, but we must be aware for all to rise above the pyramid and eye
If we don't demand the truth, their justice will never be served

Beg bread from a murderer (I won't)
Beg bread from a murderer (I won't)
Beg bread!
Beg bread from a murderer
Beg bread from a murderer
Beg bread from a murderer
Beg bread!

Call me a pariah, it doesn't matter what you do to me
Can't kill the desire to find the truth that sets us free
Call me a pariah, it doesn't matter what you do!
Born in blood (they rule by secrecy)
Born in blood (the 33rd degrees)
Call me a pariah, it doesn't matter what you do to me
Can't kill the desire to find the truth that sets us free

I won't let you keep killing off my prophets
I'll do all I can to stop you, to bring an end
The deceit will face defeat
Together we can end their reign
The deceit will face defeat
Together we can end their reign
