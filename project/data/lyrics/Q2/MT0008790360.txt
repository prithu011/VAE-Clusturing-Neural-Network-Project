Forgotten memories that touches our minds
Painful splinters of a cold relief
A humble bow in front of a war to come
Species allied from the dawn of time
Lie scattered on the brinks of hell
Not more then a whisper, a sigh of faith

Ascending hate outlines our path
Into the precipitous oblivion
Glorified acts of violence produces
The foundation to our ruin
Conditions are right

Exclusively yours, not more than a whisper
A sigh of a forgotten faith
Contaminated mind
Creator of the growing feud
Contaminated soul
Creator of a conclusive war
Forgotten memories that touches our minds
Painful splinters of a cold relief
A humble bow in front of a war to come
Species allied from the dawn of time
Lie scattered on the brinks of hell
Not more then a whisper, a sigh of faith

Desolate planes, human destructive glory
Lingers in the hollow remains
Of a slowly penetrating anger
We're tied up in darkness, helplessly bound

Exclusively yours, not more than a whisper
A sigh of a forgotten faith
Contaminated mind
Creator of the growing feud
Contaminated soul
Creator of a conclusive war
