Nocturnal drapery
His twilight has now gone
As the bloodred shadow will fall
This hellish well will be cast upon...Forced upon all

Drain the veins of his lifeblood...Crush the hope of his believers
Leave his ashen body for the worms...Drowning the vision of his love
Suffocate the thought of his reprisal

For our legion has now beseated
The throne of judgement
The seeds of truth have now been sown
God will die alone

We vomit forth the chaos...Our violence uncontrolled
Succumb to my truth...Your death will be our conquest
Praying as you fall...Into the void of damnation
May you live in torment
Suffer in the Hell that we created
The kind of all lies...Thorned fools demise

Whipped upon your back...Rush of deliverance
Stabbing through your breast...This dagger shall deliver
Cyanide blast into your veins...We cease the life of their holy reign
Our nation is to cause you unrelenting pain

May you live in torment
Suffer in the Hell that we created
The kind of all lies...Thorned fools demise

Choosing the one with the infernal horns
The one with black wings proudly soars
Across the path you've wandered upon
See your momments of faith...Charred
In Satan we trust...Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan

Salt rubbed within your wounds
Stagger through the hordes of impiety
Spit drips from your beaten shell
Humilated before the chosen few

Drain the veins of his lifeblood...Crush the hope of his believers
Leave his ashen body for the worms...Drowning the vision of his love
Suffocate the thought of his reprisal
Let the swine, called god, be disgraced
Crawl unto me on bloodied hands and knees
Rush of deliverance...Relive this act of blasphemy
Unfurl your pain to me...Suffering is your destiny

We vomit forth the chaos...Our violence uncontrolled
Succumb to my truth..Your death will be our conquest
Praying as you fall...Into the void of damnation

May you live in torment
Suffer in the Hell that we created
The kind of all lies...Thorned fools demise

Whipped upon your back...Rush of deliverance
Stabbing through your breast...This dagger shall deliver
Cyanide blast into your veins...We cease the life of their holy reign
Our nation is to cause you unrelenting pain

May you live in torment
Suffer in the Hell that we created
The kind of all lies...Thorned fools demise

Choosing the one with the infernal horns
The one with black wings proudly soars
Across the path you've wandered upon
See your momments of faith...Charred
In Satan we trust...Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan
