Interrupting all programmes:
This is Radio Clash from pirate satellite
Orbiting your living room
Cashing in the Bill of Rights
Cuban army surplus or refusing all third lights
This is Radio Clash on pirate satellite, yeah

Let's get it!

This sound does not subscribe
To the international plan
In the psycho shadow of the white right hand
Then that see ghettology as an urban Vietnam
Giving deadly exhibitions of murder by napalm

This is Radio Clash tearing up the seven veils
This is Radio Clash please save us, not the whales
This is Radio Clash underneath a mushroom cloud
This is Radio Clash
You don't need that funeral shroud

Forces have been looting
My humanity
Curfews have been curbing
The end of liberty (Yeah)
Hands of law have sorted through
My identity
But now this sound is brave
And wants to be free (Anyway to be free)

This is Radio Clash on pirate satellite
This is not free Europe
Not an armed force network
This is Radio Clash using audio ammunition
This is Radio Clash can we get that world to listen?
This is Radio Clash using aural ammunition
This is Radio Clash can we get that world to listen?
This is Radio Clash on pirate satellite
Orbiting your living room
Cashing in the Bill of Rights
This is Radio Clash on pirate satellite
This is Radio Clash everybody hold on tight!

A-riggy diggy dig dang dang
Go back to urban 'Nam
