Feel the warmth of the flame as it burns inside
Burning high and higher pressure starts to climb
Turning passion into sweat, Jekyll into Hyde
Glossy eyed, unsatisfied, I can't help but deny
As my love gets set aside
As my love gets set aside
Magnified by hate inside

Face down upon the ground
Lookin' down at her, you start to frown
Thinking to yourself
"Am I insane to do the things I do to her in vain?"

Woman beater with your hands wrapped around her neck
Deranged, demented, a psycho-social wreck
Your self-denial, hatred got to keep it in check
You rape for love and you kill for respect
