You take part in creating this system
That we all must suffer in
We can't stop going round and round
We got to fix this rat race
This is the system you helped to create
They use you for corruption schemes
You're the unrealized and intended
You're the one the one they don't like
You let them know your fears
This is the system you helped to create
You ask me why I'm fighting the system
Why I'm preaching anarchy
I'm fighting for the freedom
Fighting for the rights
For the likes of you and me
This is the system you helped to create
This is the system you helped to create
