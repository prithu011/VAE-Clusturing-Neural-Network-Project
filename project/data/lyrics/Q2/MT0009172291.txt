Ride! Ride! Ride the crippled horse
Ride the broken mare
Ride the jaundice buck
Ride the dead Pegasus

You're so fucked up, you're a fucking mess
Ride the naseous horse
Ride the broken mare
Ride the bony nag
Ride the tattered pony

You're so fucked up, you're a fucking mess

Manes in your mouth, hooves on your chest
From the country club, girl. To the crypt now, girl
Saddle up now, girl
Climb into the television
Stick your horrible nose into every sitcom
Into the vile game show host's
Cockpit mouth and down his throat
Jump over jungles cooking in napalm
Leap over nations shaved by carpet bombs
Into the burning treasury and set the heart attack children free
C'mon pony, deman your rights
C'mon pony, demand your rights!

Prance into the halls of Congress, vomit into the speakers lap
Gallop into your romance novels, dance atop heavy pectorals

Ride! Ride!

You're so fucked up, you're a fucking mess
Trash can saddle
Ride in the show pony parade
And collapse
And come in fucking last
