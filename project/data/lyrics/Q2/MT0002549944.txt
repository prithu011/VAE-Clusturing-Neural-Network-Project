I'm layin low layin' low, I'm c-c-creepin
I'm p-p-pushin my breath, just q-q-quiet
No speakin', speakin' from shadows, c-c-corners, a phantom
With steps, amp up with cold hate, where the knife is decapitated

You can't cut surgically with a shaky hand
And honestly, my nerves are shot again
So please be a doll and rest your head
In my hands

You can't cut surgically with a shaky hand
And honestly my nerves are shot again
Let me treat you like a doll and snap your neck
In my hands

In my hand In my hand is this blade, was a gift
And I never wanna give it back, it's a slave to my fist
A little bit to help it to relax, I'm amazed it'll stay sharp forever
And if I take real good care of this shit, it won't go away
In my playhouse, I lay foundation
But I think it was a little much, not enough coupons cut
But I hold of a lost trust and I'm dazed
I could play it smart forever, just wasn't down for whatever
You know, that shit went away, but I'll act tough

I walk tall and c-c-carry a big bag of wrenches
And if you call, I'll play mechanic, fake till I fix it
Sick as an -ism, stickin' to this, holdin' due to the shape
All I got is the cold curve of that blade, so I'm sunburnt

That should tell you what's what, I got nicked
I'm pressin' just to keep the blood in the cut
Fade to black like a hemophiliac, fully afflicted
Sick of your... snap, the k-k-killin' is in me

You can't cut surgically with a shaky hand
And honestly, my nerves are shot again
So please be a doll and rest your head
In my hands

You can't cut surgically with a shaky hand
And honestly my nerves are shot again
Let me treat you like a doll and snap your neck
In my hands
And it's gone, wash your hands of this
And I know you never lookin' back, don't just stand there, just

And it's strange, I could accept it, but check it
See, I'm just happy with a piece of you
And I'm sane in the brain, truth is I'm simmerin' here
Steady lookin' for a bit of hope and I hope that you get it

When I'm steady comin' for your throat and it's strange
See it's been dormant and docile
But if you poke a pet too much too long
That shit'll turn hostile

I'm layin low layin' low, I'm c-c-creepin
I'm p-p-pushin my breath, just q-q-quiet
No speakin', speakin' from shadows, c-c-corners, a phantom
With steps, amp up with cold hate, where the knife is decapitated

I'm lookin' to follow
Back with the light
I'm lookin' to follow
The blood will feed the love

Tucked away in a heart snapped and stripped of it's guard
Tucked away in a hole carefully picked in the yard
Sinfully slippin through shades, lickin cries and snivellin'
Something so significant dies, who's the beast?
Who bears the burden?
Dirt, prepare for your feast
If wary eyes, could sight for sore
No there'd be nothin' to see (nuh-uh)
Adapt adjust to maladjusted to me
Under dirt and over concrete, tonight we sleep like angels

You can't cut surgically with a shaky hand
And honestly, my nerves are shot again
So please be a doll and rest your head
In my hands

You can't cut surgically with a shaky hand
And honestly my nerves are shot again
Let me treat you like a doll and snap your neck
In my hands
