We'll beat this corruption, reverse the destruction, we'll stand as one
- unite to conquer those who betrayed and attacked through greed
Rise up against the hatred
A new breed dictatorship spreading the disease as we die
Their disease is war
Their disease is hate
We must purify to prevail

Breaking the hold before we fall our spirits guide us on our way, smash down the walls and rise again, reclaim the innocence that binds us to our fate
In the battle within all weak will die, without the innocence we will not survive, without the memories we have only fear, without the soul - the life we must lead
Listen with your heart
See the world with new eyes
Rise up and justify your life - rise up and justify your life to save your soul
Rise up and justify innocence
We will survive
