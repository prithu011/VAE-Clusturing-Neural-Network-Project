Reign of fear, of war
Of silence, of resignation
Under the rules of the book of lies
Trawling the wrong path
Led like cattle

Never try to understand, accept, obey
Follow followers
And forget who you are

What's a lifestyle, to live for others
To share all with everybody
To answer love to hate

Never try to understand, accept, obey
Follow followers
And forget who you are
Take each single insult and injury
As a present, as a spiritual gold
To by your place in heaven

I spit at your god's face
I piss on the cross
I vomit on the holy bible
I shit on the blessed whore and her bastard son
I desecrate, crush and destroy
All which is sacred, all which is blessed
I've found the one who lives in me

Brothers and sisters
Time for change is coming
Bells for revenge strike the end of times

By faith, by force
We'll walk toward the light
And forever be our own god
