Watch the twilight
Colour the sky
In this monotony of chaos
Insane limbo
Sickening sights
In this garden of dark delights

Lunatic dreams become nightmare reality
Entangled into persistence
No answer to your existence

The curse has come
We've been waiting all to long
Morbid enlightener of souls
Wandering distant and alone
Deboned and defleshed
Denied is our lives
Enter our graves
Exalted as we die

True hell on earth
Forget the burning heavens
Dedicated
To the lord of living pain

Motherfucker
Who told you hell was warm
Infernal winter
The ninth circle closed
