I'm tired of all the dirty looks
For all my life it's all I've known
And I've got the scars to prove it
But I know I'm not alone... Not alone

Has anyone got an answer? Tear down the walls!
Has anyone got a clue? Tear down the walls!

I've tried to be the nice guy sometimes
And I just got fucked over again and again
So I wrap myself in this blanket
And resign myself to loneliness

Can anyone find the way out? Tear down the walls!
Can anyone get through? Tear down the walls!
Has anyone got an answer? Tear down the walls!
Has anyone got a clue? Tear down the walls!

There's no point in fighting
When you know you're going to lose
But there's no way to keep you down for the count
If that's the path you choose

Can anyone find the way out? Tear down the walls!
Can anyone get through? Tear down the walls!
Has anyone got an answer? Tear down the walls!
Has anyone got a clue? Tear down the walls!
