The sun is shining, but I don't know if it'll shine again
The sky is clear now, but the clouds wait overhead
The wind stopped blowing, but I see the trees are flowing
The water's calm now feel the undertow towing me down
Towing me down

The sun's gone down now behind the dark clouds looming
Birds stop singing, silence so soothing
Dark clouds open up, I hold my rain-soaked head
Thoughts are racing by, I scream and wish that I was dead
I wish that I was dead

Gotta find a way in this world to cope
Gotta find a place in this world with hope
Gotta find a way to keep my head straight another day
I pray to let go of hate I break myself away from my mind
I search for inner peace I never find
