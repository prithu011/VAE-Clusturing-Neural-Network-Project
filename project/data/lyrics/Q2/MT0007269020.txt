Sun, the sun shines on your back
Down, down in your shallow grave
Sun, the sun shines on your back
Down, down in your shallow grave

Sadist ways

Sadist ways

Bring violence
Visions of death
Bring visions of your past
We move at night
Day from the light
The pain will surely last
Your fucking life is dying
Your soul is cursed
Nightmares have come to be real, and...
You dream of the worst

A blast across your back
Blast of fire!
Bullets ripping through your flesh
Tearing apart
Your soul, you'll pray for death
Call my name, I'm the king of pain!

Yeah!

Create your Hell
We yield the fire
Spill blood with blade
Black sadist ways
Peel back your skin
Who's the one you'll call to save?

Your fucking life is dying
Your soul is cursed
Nightmares have come to be real, and...
You dream of the worst
A blast across your back
Blast of fire!
Bullets ripping through your flesh
Tearing apart
Your soul, you'll pray for death
Call my name, I'm the king of pain!

Yeah!

One step forward and you'll fall to
Your fiery end
Wish that you'd lived your life for all it was meant
Your life unfolded, beaten by the hands of time
One step forward and you'll fall to
Your fiery end
Wish that you'd lived your life for all it was meant
Your life unfolded, beaten by the hands of time
